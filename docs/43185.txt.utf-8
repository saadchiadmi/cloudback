NOTE.


_The character of Coriolanus Wellington, to carry out successfully
the idea of the author, should be played with an extreme degree of
solemnity, so as to appear ludicrous. His action should be of the lofty
and dignified order, but greatly overdrawn, and he should be decidedly
mechanical in his movements and gestures._




BY FORCE OF IMPULSE.




ACT 1.


                   =Scene 1=: DOLLERCLUTCH'S OFFICE.

    =Enter= _DOLLERCLUTCH, D. R. 4 E., with lawyer's bag. He empties
    his pockets of papers, etc., on desk, L. 3 E., while speaking._

=Dol.= Now if that isn't confoundedly provoking, I'd just like to know
what is. There I've been on a ninety-mile journey; and what did I gain?
Nothing, absolutely nothing, and just to think of throwing away so much
money for railroad travel, only to have the satisfaction of knowing
that you have added to the pile of monopoly and have nothing in return.
Confound these railroad companies anyhow! Honest people subscribe to
the stock and build them; then come along these "stock jobbing sharks,"
who corner the stocks and put the road in their vest-pockets. And they
call that business; but it's only another name for d--n robbery. But
where is that confounded Coriolanus? [_Calls._] Coriolanus! Coriolanus!
Just like the rascal. Whenever you want him, nowhere to be found.
When he is about, what good is he with his stuck up manners and airs?
Thinks himself born to fill a higher sphere in life. But the only
thing he's good for is to stand him in the entry and use him for a hat
rack. Confound him anyhow! [_Calls._] Coriolanus! [_Listens._] Where
the deuce can he be? To gratify him I answered an advertisement for a
position, which, he says, would be more suitable for his intellectual
and genteel qualities--and, if it is only successful I shall be well
rid of the rascal. [_Picks up letter._] Hello! just the thing, by
jingo! [_Reads._] "Terms satisfactory. If convenient come at once. The
position is man-servant; but, as I am away at business during the day,
I want a reliable and intelligent person to supervise the work about
the premises, and be a protector to the females." That will just please
him, and it will just please me to get rid of him. [_CORIOLANUS puts
his head in C. door._]

=Cor.= Was I mistaken, or did the sound of your voice penetrate the
cavity of my ear?

=Dol.= Did I call? Well, if that ain't cool! Call? Of course I
did!--and why the deuce didn't you come immediately?

                          CORIOLANUS =Enters=.

=Cor.= Because, my dear sir, I was otherwise engaged, and I felt
assured that you would indulge me to that extent and postpone your
desires to my especial accommodation. Thank you! [_With a wave of the
hand._]

=Dol.= Oh! and how in thunder were you engaged?

=Cor.= [_Loftily._] I was paring my finger nails.

=Dol.= Oh! Oh! [_Falls in chair at desk._] This is too much. To return
travel-wearied and hungry, and be made to wait by such a jackass. And
I must be at court at ten, and [_pulls out watch_] it's nine now.
[_Starts up in a rage._] I'll not stand it, sir! I'll throw you out of
the window!

=Cor.= [_R. C._] Indeed! Then I should be at a loss to wonder what
could be the matter with the door. Stay your temper, sir! It is
decidedly unbecoming a man of your years. Preserve a calm dignity such
as I furnish a striking example of.

=Dol.= [_Disgusted._] There, sir! [_Hands him letter._] This is the
gratitude I receive for what I have done for you. Read it, and I hope
you will have as much joy of it as I have in getting rid of you.

=Cor.= Thank you! Thanks! You have performed your duty well. Some day I
will return the kindness; I shall engage you as my lawyer.

=Dol.= Get out, or I shall be tempted to do you an injury. Get your
things ready to leave to-night, sir! I'll not put up with your nonsense
and impudence another day. Now go, sir! and order a lunch for me at the
restaurant, to be sent here--and mind you see that I am not disturbed
until court time. I've got more than I can do to prepare my cases for
this morning's court. I may forget the flight of time, in which case
you will please come in and remind me of court time.

=Cor.= Your wishes shall be obeyed. I fly to execute your orders.
[=Exit= _D. R. 4 E._]

=Dol.= [_At desk L. 3 E._] George Washington, you're a fool--your
magnanimous nature has suffered you to be imposed upon--you're
a--[_CORIOLANUS puts his head in D. R. 4 E._]

=Cor.= I beg your pardon, sir! [_He_ =Enters=.] In the excitement of
the moment I neglected to inform you that a lady called to see you. I
informed her that you were out of town. She was much distressed at the
information. She waited for you until eight o'clock, when she left in a
state of great mental excitement. She's been waiting since six o'clock
this morning, waiting your arrival.

=Dol.= If she comes back don't let her in. Tell her to come to-morrow
morning. I cannot attend to any more business before court. [_He busies
himself among papers._]

=Cor.= [_Bows._] I fly! [=Exit= _D. R. 4 E._]

=Dol.= Egad! Some people must think lawyers are made of iron and work
like machines! No! I'll listen to no more cases before court. I've
only got one head and one pair of arms. [_CORIOLANUS puts his head in
D. R. 4 E. To CORIOLANUS._] Well, sir! What now?

=Cor.= [=Enters.=] She's come back! I delivered your message. She wrung
her hands and said she came eighteen miles to see you, and she must
return at noon.

=Dol.= I can't help it! She must come another time. I positively
decline to see any one before court.

=Cor.= I quicken! [=Exit= _D. R. 4 E._]

=Dol.= Some one without money to try to enlist my sympathies in helping
some scalawag out of trouble. Not long ago I defended a tramp whom I
thought unjustly used. I helped him out of the scrape and gave him
a bowl of soup and some alms to help him on--and how did the rascal
serve me? He published it about the town, and for two weeks I had every
tramp from fifty miles around at my door begging for soup and alms.
You don't get George Washington Dollerclutch in such a scrape again.
[_Sees newspaper._] Hello! what's this? [_Picks up paper and adjusts
spectacles. Reads._] "On the Brink of a Civil War." Lord bless us!
[_Adjusts his glasses._] "Slavery and Anti-Slavery." "The Inauguration
of Lincoln." Ah! That's my man--Old honest Abe! He'll show those
rascally slave masters a thing or two before he's done with them.
[_Reads._] "Firing on Fort Sumter." "Major Ander--"[_Drops paper._]
Hang it all! I can't get that girl out of my mind. What the dickens
did she want to say that for, anyhow? [_Sighs._] Well! Well! [_Picks
up paper and reads._] "Major Anderson with seventy men, after a brave
resistance of three hours against five thousand Secessionists, was
finally obliged to surrender." Eighteen miles to see me? It must be an
important case. [_Rises to his feet._] Confound it anyhow! Why did I
let it slip? [_Calls._] Coriolanus!

                    =Enter= _CORIOLANUS, D. R. 4 E._

=Cor.= You have called! I have obeyed your summons.

=Dol.= Hold your tongue! Just go at once, and run after that girl and
bring her back.

=Cor.= [_Bows._] I quicken! [=Exit= _D. R. 4 E._]

=Dol.= Why the dickens does she want to come here and upset my peace of
mind?

   =Enter= _CORIOLANUS, D. R. 4 E. He goes to R. C. DOLLERCLUTCH C._

=Cor.= In compliance with your desire, I have brought her back and left
her on the door-step.

=Dol.= You thundering blockhead! Why didn't you bring her up here? Why
the devil did you send her away in the first place? Here I'm losing all
this valuable time. Usher her up at once.

=Cor.= I quicken! [=Exit= _CORIOLANUS, D. R. 4 E. DOLLERCLUTCH busies
himself among his papers._]

=Dol.= Perhaps she's a fine rich lady, and I'll have a fat case. If
not, I'll have nothing to do with her. I'll hustle her off in short
order. I'll crush her with a look.

           =Enter= _CORIOLANUS, D. R. 4 E., bowing in HILDA._

=Dol.= [_Aside, looking at HILDA._] H'm! No money in her case. I'll
have nothing to do with it!

=Cor.= [_At D. R. 4 E._] My mission I've fulfilled; your pleasure I
await.

=Dol.= [_To CORIOLANUS._] Get out! Didn't I tell you not to let me be
disturbed before court?

=Cor.= I'll make an honorable retreat. [=Exit= _D. R. 4 E._]

=Hil.= [_C._] I beg your pardon, sir! Are you not Mr. Dollerclutch, the
lawyer?

=Dol.= Now, ain't you ashamed of yourself hanging around a gentleman's
door and carrying on in such an outlandish manner, when I'm so busy, eh?

=Hil.= I am very sorry, sir, but--but--

=Dol.= But what?

=Hil.= Oh, sir! I--I--

=Dol.= It's no use! It'll cost you two hundred dollars to look at me.
Take my advice and go home and leave law alone. I dismiss the case.
I'll not charge you a cent for that advice. Don't you say another
word--good day! [_Waves his hand. He busies himself among his papers.
HILDA wrings her hands. After a pause._] Well, why don't you say
something? What's your name?

=Hil.= Hilda Wallace, sir!

=Dol.= Humph! Trying to raise a subscription for an able-bodied
invalid, I suppose?

=Hil.= Oh, no, sir! I come to see if you could not help a poor girl out
of a sad trouble.

=Dol.= [_Aside._] I thought so! Trying to work the sympathetic dodge.
[_To HILDA._] What! Do you want to get a divorce?

=Hil.= No, sir! I came to see if you could find out who my parents are,
and, also, whether I am married or not.

=Dol.= Lord, bless us! The girl must be crazy!

=Hil.= [_At desk._] Oh, sir! just listen to my story, and I know that
you will be able to help me in this, my sore trouble.

=Dol.= [_Crosses to R., pulls forward two chairs, and motions HILDA to
be seated._] Well, well! go on! [_Aside._] There's the morning's court
business, and not a thing done. [_HILDA sits L. C. DOLLERCLUTCH R. C._]

=Hil.= I was brought up by a family named Wallace, who live in Norfolk,
Virginia, and I supposed that I was their daughter, until a discovery
I made two years ago convinced me that I was not.

=Dol.= [_Getting interested._] And what discovery did you make?

=Hil.= [_Unfolding a package._] I found this dress hidden away in one
of the bureau drawers. [_Hands it to him._]

=Dol.= Lord, bless me! Why, it's a baby dress.

=Hil.= Yes, sir! and when I made inquiries about it I learned that it
was one I wore when a child.

=Dol.= Well, there was nothing strange about that?

=Hil.= No, sir! But on examination, I found these initials, A. M.,
which you see worked in it!

=Dol.= Ah! yes! Precisely!

=Hil.= And when I called their attention to it they seemed confused and
did not know what to reply. I kept the dress, determined to find out
more, if I could!

=Dol.= And you did?

=Hil.= No, sir! but I learned since that the man I married could unveil
the mystery which shrouds my birth.

=Dol.= And won't he enlighten you?

=Hil.= No, sir! all my attempts have proved futile.

=Dol.= But did you not say that this man was your husband?

=Hil.= Yes, sir! But he must have some object in keeping my identity
secret.

=Dol.= But how did you become acquainted with this man, and how did you
come to marry him?

=Hil.= He was a regular visitor at our home, and I noticed on many
occasions that he paid Mrs. Wallace money. However, I fell desperately
in love with him, and when he proposed that we get married, I, of
course, was only too happy to consent.

=Dol.= And his name?

=Hil.= Ralph Murdell!

=Dol.= Ralph Murdell! Humph! I don't like the name--got a bad sound to
it.

=Hil.= He took me to a little village in the suburbs about four miles
from Norfolk, where we were married in a little chapel by an old
country preacher.

=Dol.= And you were happy, I suppose?

=Hil.= Yes, until about two weeks later, when he was about to leave
me. He said he had to go North to attend to some business. I would not
listen to it, unless he took me with him.

=Dol.= That's right, my girl! And he took you, of course?

=Hil.= Yes; but it was on condition that I should keep the marriage a
secret, and not recognize him in the presence of others.

=Dol.= And what the deuce was that for?

=Hil.= He said his family were very proud, and he wanted to gain their
consent before he made our marriage public.

=Dol.= Oh, the rascal! And you listened to him?

=Hil.= Yes, sir! To my sorrow, I did. He recommended me to a young lady
who wanted a lady's maid. I accepted the position on his assurance that
he would soon claim me before the world as his wife.

=Dol.= And who is this lady with whom you now are?

=Hil.= Adrienne Lowville!

=Dol.= What! The daughter of Wm. Lowville, who owns Beachwood, eighteen
miles from here, on the Essex road?

=Hil.= Oh, yes, sir! Do you know him?

=Dol.= Well, I'd like to know who don't! Got a railroad in each pocket.
But, about your husband--is he acquainted there?

=Hil.= Alas! yes! He is a constant visitor, and I more than suspect
that his attentions to my mistress imply more than he wishes me to
believe.

=Dol.= [_Throws baby dress on table, R. 3 E._] Oh! That's his game, is
it? A case of throwing you over for her, eh?

=Hil.= I fear so, sir; for she is madly in love with him, and thinks
him a saint. When I called him to account for his actions, he laughed
at me. He then informed me that he would do as he pleased, and that I
was not his wife at all; that ours was a mock marriage.

=Dol.= [_Jumps up._] The deuce he did! Oh, the villain, to take
advantage of a poor innocent girl.

=Hil.= [_Rises._] Oh, sir! but it was legal--it--

=Dol.= [_DOLLERCLUTCH L. C., HILDA R. C._] Have you got your marriage
certificate?

=Hil.= No, sir! I never thought of that, sir.

=Dol.= Then, what proof have you?

=Hil.= Alas, none! But, oh sir! can't you investigate it? There surely
must be a record kept of all marriages. Can't you get a copy of the
church register, where it must have been entered?

=Dol.= That's so! I never thought of that! But, my dear girl, that will
be a difficult matter, now that the country is in a _furore_ and on the
verge of a civil war; and it will cost money to do it, my dear girl;
money.

=Hil.= [_Crosses to desk L. 3 E._] Oh, sir! I thought of that! Here
are twelve dollars that I saved out of my scanty earnings. Won't it be
enough, sir?

=Dol.= [_Up C._] Enough? Why, it wouldn't pay for dipping a pen into
the ink, to say nothing about the trouble of licking a postage stamp.

=Hil.= [_Sobs._] What shall I do--what shall I do?

=Dol.= [_Taking out handkerchief._] Take up that money and put it in
your pocket immediately! I'll not take a cent of it. I never was so
insulted in my life. [_Crosses to R._]

=Hil.= [_C._] Oh, won't you help me out of my trouble?

=Dol.= Help you? Of course I will! Who said I wouldn't? Do you think
I'll stand by and see an innocent girl wronged in this manner? No! I'll
see this thing through, if it costs me a fortune! Oh, the villain!
[_DOLLERCLUTCH at desk, HILDA at table R. 2 E._]

             =Enter= _CORIOLANUS, D. R. 4 E., with lunch._

=Cor.= Your lunch, sir! [_Puts it on desk._]

=Dol.= D--n the lunch! Get out!

=Cor.= I quicken! [=Exit= _D. C. HILDA sobs. She picks up baby dress
from table._]

=Dol.= [_Down C._] What are you crying about?

=Hil.= I am so grateful to you, sir, for taking a poor girl's trouble
to heart.

=Dol.= Now, don't you be deluding yourself with any such idea. This is
business, I tell you; business. What do you know about business, I'd
like to know?

=Hil.= I beg your pardon, sir!

=Dol.= Why do you come and arouse my sympathetic heart, and upset all
my court business?

=Hil.= Can I do aught, sir?

=Dol.= No--yes--that is--shut up! Give me that dress! Now, you go back
and don't let that husband of yours suspect anything. [_Puts on his
hat, etc. DOLLERCLUTCH at desk, HILDA C._]

=Hil.= Are you going out, sir?

=Dol.= Hold your tongue! This is the way I prepare myself for court
business; and there's my nice lunch, too! [_Stuffs baby dress in his
bosom, leaving a part sticking out._] Now, go home and don't bother me
till you hear from me. I'm going to take the first train for Norfolk!

                    =Enter= _CORIOLANUS at door C._

=Cor.= It's time to go to court!

=Dol.= D--n the court! I'll see this thing through. [_He bolts for the
C. door and upsets CORIOLANUS in his haste to get out._ =Exit= _through
C. door._]

=Cor.= The court is sitting! [_CORIOLANUS C., HILDA L. C. Whistle
scene._]


    =Scene 2=: WOOD-PASS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF WILLIAM LOWVILLE'S
    RESIDENCE AT BEACHWOOD.

      =Enter= _HENRY LOWVILLE, R. 2 E., with gun resting on arm._

=Hen.= [_Looking off L. E._] The guests are beginning to arrive, and
I suppose I must, as a member of the family, be on hand and help do
the honors of entertaining the motley crowd. [_Sighs._] Ah! how I hate
the hollow mockery of fashionable society--how I hate to mingle in the
giddy deception hidden under the guise of polite gentility--bah!

                      =Enter= _REGINALD, L. 2 E._

=Reg.= Why, how now, Henry! One of your melancholy fits again? Ha! ha!
ha! [_Shakes hands._]

=Hen.= Yes, confoundedly so! I've got the blues with a vengeance.

=Reg.= Come, come, old fellow, shake off this feeling. Why, you look as
if you had buried your best friend. Come, have a weed! [_Offers segar
case._] Nothing like a smoke, you know, to calm a perturbed mind.

=Hen.= [_Lights segar._] Yes, there is a certain soothing influence
about it; that's a fact.

=Reg.= Ah! now you look more like yourself. But how is this--why are
you not at your post, doing the honors to the guests?

=Hen.= Because I hate these empty shows. What are all these receptions
but one maze of dissipation, where everybody seems to outdo the other
in silliness?

=Reg.= I agree with you there, Henry. There are many sins and much
hypocrisy and deceit practiced under the veil of studied politeness,
and the sacred bond of friendship becomes a mere matter of form to
further the ends of frivolous and sordid desires.

=Hen.= And the women! All deception, heartless, fickle. Show me a woman
in this gilded age of fashion devoid of fashion's impress--devoid of--

=Reg.= Nay, Henry! You are prejudiced--all women are not so. There are
still many who possess all the noble attributes that Heaven instilled
in her heart, that make her all that is beautiful and endearing in the
eyes of a true man.

=Hen.= Yes; but artificial show has supplanted her--I know not the
ideal.

=Reg.= Aye! but I know one.

=Hen.= And she is--

=Reg.= Your sister Adrienne!

=Hen.= Oho! I understand. Ha! ha! ha! Well, well, there's my hand on
it. I give in. There is no one in the wide world that I would be more
pleased to call brother.

=Reg.= [_Confused._] You misunderstand--you--

=Hen.= Well, well; so be it. But I had better go up to the mansion
and make the guests comfortable, and help Adrienne complete the
arrangements for the grand ball this evening. Will you come? [_Crosses
to L. REGINALD to R._]

=Reg.= Not just at present. I want to have a little quiet stroll in
these grand old woods; besides, I want to finish my weed.

=Hen.= Well, I'm off! [=Exit= _L. 2 E._]

=Reg.= As good a fellow as ever lived; with a tinge of melancholy in
his make-up, and a little bitter against the female sex in general.
Heigho! Probably a victim of a heartless coquette. Hum! That awkward
slip of the tongue has betrayed me. He has discovered my feelings
toward Adrienne. [_Leans against tree, L. 2 E., in a study._]

    =Enter= _SAMMY DEWDROP and ADOLPHUS SOFTHEAD, R. 2 E. They do not
    perceive REGINALD._

=Sammy.= [_C._] Hang it all if I don't think we've lost the way!
[_Looks around._]

=Adolphus.= [_R. C._] Why didn't you listen to me and come by the
regular road? Oh, Sammy! What if night should overtake us? Oh! oh!
[_SAMMY scratches his head. REGINALD perceives them._]

=Reg.= [_Aside._] Two big school-boys!

=Sam.= Now, look a'here, Adolphus! How did I know we'd get in such a
pickle? [_Sees sign on tree R. F._] Hurrah! We're all right! Here's a
finger-post! [_SAMMY R. C. ADOLPHUS C. Reads_:] "Beware!" [_ADOLPHUS
jumps in terror._] "Do not disturb the deer." Oh, pshaw! What shall we
do?

=Adol.= I wish I'd stayed home!

=Sam.= It was all your fault that we came. You said there would be lots
of nice girls there, and we should be sure to fall in love with ever so
many.

=Reg.= Ha! ha! ha!

=Adol.= [_Scared._] Oh! oh!

=Sam.= [_Clutches ADOLPHUS fearfully._] What was that?

=Reg.= [_Comes forward, smiling. ADOLPHUS R. C. SAMMY C. REGINALD L.
C._] Gentlemen, you seem distressed. Can I serve you?

=Sam.= [_Brightens up suddenly. To ADOLPHUS._] Oh! you coward, to get
frightened like that! Why can't you be brave like me?

=Adol.= You were just as afraid as I was.

=Reg.= [_Laughs._] Have a smoke? [_Offers cigar-case to SAMMY._] It
will help to quiet your nerves.

=Adol.= [_To SAMMY, aside._] Oh, Lucifer! I never smoked in my life.

=Sam.= Neither did I! But we must take one, you know; it isn't polite
to refuse--besides, all men smoke.

=Adol.= Black as ink! Strong as old Nick, I bet.

=Reg.= You seem to have lost your way.

=Sam.= We were on our way to Holly Mansion, when we lost our way in
this confounded jungle.

=Reg.= Ah! Then I can be of service to you. That is my destination,
also, and if agreeable, I shall be most happy to guide you. [_With mock
politeness. SAMMY and ADOLPHUS both try to shake hands with REGINALD at
once. They both speak together._]

=Sam.= You're a trump.

=Adol.= Put it there, old boy!

=Reg.= This way, gentlemen! [=Exeunt=, _L. 2 E. Whistle scene._]


          =Scene 3=: GARDEN ADJOINING WM. LOWVILLE'S MANSION.

   =Enter= _ANASTASIA MAITLAND, and CORIOLANUS with valise, L. 2 E._

=Anastasia.= Well, I never! Not a soul about to receive me. And after
all that jaunt from the station, too. I declare it's an outrage. They
could have sent their carriage to the station for me, to say the least.
If there was somebody about, I should feel inclined to faint. [_Sits on
bench, L. 3 E._] Coriolanus!

=Cor.= [_At R. C. Bows stiffly._] Your pleasure, madam!

=Anas.= Get my smelling-bottle out of the valise--be quick!

=Cor.= [_Puts down valise._] I quicken!

=Anas.= And there's Reginald; why was he not at the station? He knew
I was coming. [_CORIOLANUS hands smelling-bottle._] Won't I give him
a piece of my mind! [_Music heard at distance._] Well, I declare.
[_Rises._] If they haven't commenced dancing already! Coriolanus, go at
once and announce my arrival.

=Cor.= Madam, I obey! I will go in advance and have the servants to
announce us. [=Exit= _R. 2 E._]

=Anas.= Announce _us_! Did I ever see such impudence--announce _us_!
Just as if _he_, a common servant, was such a distinguished personage
as I am. Oh! it's disgusting! [=Exit= _R. 2 E._]

                 =Enter= _ADRIENNE and HILDA, R. 4 E._

=Adrienne.= Did you arrange the flowers on the table, as I desired?

=Hil.= Yes, my lady!

=Adri.= [_Sits on bench, R. 3 E._] What a beautiful evening! All nature
seems hushed, as if it had gone to sleep on the broad bosom of the day.
[_Sighs._] Hilda, were you ever in love?

=Hil.= [_Standing L. of bench._] Yes--no--that is, I--I--

=Adri.= [_Laughs._] Why, you silly little goose. You act as if it were
a crime to be in love. You tremble like a leaf.

=Hil.= I--I am cold. The night air is chilly. If you'll excuse me, I
will go in and get a shawl.

=Adri.= Oh, certainly. [_HILDA is about to go._] Hilda, when you go
in, peep into the parlor and see if Ralph--I mean, Mr. Murdell, has
arrived.

=Hil.= Yes, madam! [_R. C. Aside._] She loves him; she cannot hide it.
[=Exit= _R. 3 E._]

=Adri.= He is late! What can detain him? He begged for the honor of the
first dance. The third has already been danced and he is not here. Oh!
how slowly the minutes glide. Ah! he comes at last.

                        =Enter= _RALPH, L. 2 E._

=Ralph.= [_L. of bench._] This is an unexpected pleasure!

=Adri.= Truant sir! This is punctuality!

=Ralph.= Allow me to offer my humblest apologies for my offense, and if
a life's devotion could repay it, command me.

=Adri.= Still the disappointment would remain.

=Ralph.= Then you were disappointed, Miss Lowville? Adrienne! [_Takes
her hand._]

=Adri.= Certainly! [_Withdraws her hand._] Why shouldn't I be when I
was debarred from the pleasure of the first dance, simply because it
was pledged to one who did not fulfill his promise? [_Music heard._]
Hark! That's the quadrille I have given to Mr. Maitland. [_About to go
to R._]

=Ralph.= [_Takes her hand and gently forces her to bench._] Nay,
Adrienne! Do not go.

=Adri.= And would you have me be a truant like you? [_They sit._]

=Ralph.= Yes, because I cannot let you go. Adrienne, long have I sought
for such an opportunity [=Enter= _HILDA R. 4 E._] to pour into your
ears the passion that is consuming me.

=Adri.= Ralph, hush! Some one approaches.

=Hil.= [_Comes forward C._] Madam! Mr. Maitland was inquiring for you
for this quadrille.

=Adri.= I almost forgot it. [_Aside to RALPH._] I'll be back presently.
[_To HILDA._] Come, Hilda! [_Both_ =Exeunt= _R. 2 E. RALPH_ =Exits= _L.
2 E._]

                 =Enter= _SAMMY and ADOLPHUS, L. 2 E._

=Sam.= [_Looking after the girls._] Did you see her? Oh, what a
heavenly being! My heart goes after her, and I guess I'll follow my
heart. [_About to rush after. ADOLPHUS pulls him back._]

=Adol.= No you don't! If anybody goes, it's me. [_About to go. SAMMY
pulls him back._]

=Sam.= I want to pour my heart in her ear!

=Adol.= And I want to let my soul mingle with hers!

=Sam.= Well, we can't both make love to her at once. I have it! We'll
draw lots! [_Pulls matches from pocket._] Who draws the short stick
proposes first, and if she refuses the short stick then the long stick
will have a chance.

=Adol.= Oh, Sammy! What a head you've got.

=Sam= [_Holds sticks towards ADOLPHUS._] Draw! [_ADOLPHUS draws long
stick._]

=Adol.= Just my luck!

=Sam.= Ah! Now, Dolphy, I'll show you how to do it. Hush! She's coming
back! Now you hide behind there. [_Pointing. ADOLPHUS hides behind
flower urn, C._]

          =Enter= _ADRIENNE, R. 2 E. SAMMY falls on his knee._

=Sam.= Most adorable angel, whose liquid eyes do penetrate the inmost
depths of my entranced soul, listen to one who has loved you from his
childhood. Fill me with ecstasy by the avowal from thy honeyed lips
that you will be forever mine.

=Adri.= [_Laughs heartily._] Rise, you foolish boy, and go home and
tell your mother to put a mustard draft on your feet and give you a
dose of paregoric.

=Sam.= [_Gets up and scratches his head._] Squashed, by Jupiter! [_He
walks to L._]

=Adri.= [_R. Aside._] Where is Ralph, I wonder!

=Adol.= [_Coming forward, C. To SAMMY._] Go home, you foolish boy, and
get some paregoric and let Adolphus take off the prize. [_ADRIENNE
turns. ADOLPHUS falls on his knee._]

=Adri.= Another proposal?

=Adol.= Fairest of the fair and fairer yet, take this my heart and do
with it what you like. It's yours forevermore. [=Enter= _REGINALD,
R. 2 E., who takes ADRIENNE'S place. ADRIENNE R., REGINALD R. C.,
ADOLPHUS C., SAMMY L._] Play with it, use it for a foot-ball--do
with it what you like, as long as you take your true Adolphus with
it. My father owns sixty-eight brick houses, twenty race horses,
three hundred slaves, and one-quarter of an acre of good farming
land--besides--[_Discovers he is talking to REGINALD._] The devil!
[_Starts and rushes off L. 2 E. SAMMY runs after him._]

=Sam.= Who had better take paregoric now? [=Exit= _L. 2 E. ADRIENNE and
REGINALD laugh._]

=Reg.= Two foolish, overgrown boys, whose mental powers have not kept
pace with their physical. Pray be seated, Miss Lowville. [_ADRIENNE
sits, bench R. 3 E. REGINALD remains standing._]

=Adri.= Mr. Maitland, I owe you an apology. I promised you a quadrille,
but I regret having disappointed you.

=Reg.= Don't mention it. I willingly submit to the disappointment,
since it has afforded me the pleasure of enjoying a few moments' quiet
conversation with one whose amiable disposition and lofty sentiments
command my profoundest respect and admiration.

=Adri.= You flatter me, sir!

=Reg.= Nay, Miss Lowville, believe me, I am sincere. I have watched
the development of noble traits, the unfolding of a noble character
prompted by a pure and loving heart; the expression of high and lofty
thought--all of which impressions have sunk so deeply into my being
that they seem a part of myself. Miss Lowville, I use no honeyed words,
but I offer you the heart and hand of an honest man, who will love,
honor and shield you through all the walks of life.

=Adri.= [_Rises._] Mr. Maitland, you honor me with the offer of such a
noble heart as yours, and could I accept it, I should be proud to wear
it in my bosom. Such noble love requires a noble love in return. But I
cannot.

=Reg.= Perhaps--in time--

=Adri.= Alas! I cannot give you hope. But friends we shall ever be.
[_REGINALD turns away._] Will you accept the hand of friendship?

=Reg.= Yes! Yes! Pardon me! Friends we shall always be. [=Exit=
_ADRIENNE, R. 2 E._]

                     =Enter= _CORIOLANUS, R. 4 E._

=Cor.= Sir Reginald, your honored aunt awaits your coming in the
conservatory.

=Reg.= I will attend her immediately. [=Exit= _REGINALD, R. 2 E._]

=Cor.= [_Coming down C._] Coriolanus, I am proud of you--you have
acquitted yourself nobly--you have made an impression upon her maiden
heart, I feel assured. She recognizes the true nobility that is hidden
under the garb of the menial. How I hate these clothes! Oh! Anastasia,
thou knowest true worth when thou see'st it. [_Walks to right._]

             =Enter= _DOLLERCLUTCH, L. 4 E. Comes down C._

=Dol.= Well, I've got here at last, and if I can only manage
to meet Hilda. But how shall I contrive to see her? [_Looks around
and sees CORIOLANUS._] Ah! there's one of the servants! I'll question
him. [_To CORIOLANUS._] Hey, there, you clown! Come here. [_CORIOLANUS
turns._] Coriolanus, by all that is wonderful. Well, this is
particularly gratifying. But, how is it that I find you here? Have you
left the other place?

=Cor.= I am a visitor here! I have escorted Miss Maitland to the grand
reception.

=Dol.= Oh! I thought you were going to say you owned this place.
However, you are just the person to do me a little service. Run to the
mansion and tell Miss Lowville's maid to step out here a moment, that
a gentleman wishes to speak to her. [_CORIOLANUS about to go in high
dudgeon._] Hold on! That won't do--it will attract attention--a few
lines will be better. [_Pulls out tablet and writes._]

=Cor.= [_Aside._] I'm no common servant! Such impudence, to ask a
gentleman like me. No, thank you! [=Exit= _in high dudgeon, R. 2 E._]

=Dol.= There, I guess that will do! [_Folding up note._]

                      =Enter= _ANASTASIA, R. 2 E._

=Dol.= Here, you clown, take this note and mind--

=Anas.= Sir!

=Dol.= The devil! [_Aside._] Where did that infernal rascal get to!
[_To ANASTASIA._] I beg a million pardons, madam! [_Aside._] Confound
that rascal! [_To ANASTASIA._] Pray pardon me, madam--a mistake, I
assure you--mistook you for another.

=Anas.= Oh!

=Dol.= [_L. Aside._] What an amiable creature!

=Anas.= [_R. Aside._] What a charming personage, and so very
polite--Hem!

=Dol.= Did you speak, madam?

=Anas.= Such a beautiful evening!

                =Enter= _RALPH, L. 4 E. He pauses at C._

=Dol.= Why, yes! and doubly so since the arrival of such charming
simplicity.

=Ralph.= Ha! ha! ha! [_Comes down C. ANASTASIA and DOLLERCLUTCH are
startled. ANASTASIA_ =Exits= _R. 2 E., with great dignity._]

=Dol.= [_L._] Were you laughing at me, sir?

=Ralph.= Yes! at the picture of charming simplicity. Ha! ha! ha!

=Dol.= Hem! perhaps your name is Paul Pry?

=Ralph.= Perhaps it is! [_With a shrug._] If you have any grievance,
there's my card. [_Hands him card, and is about to go._]

=Dol.= [_Looks at card. Aside._] Ralph Murdell?--the devil! [_To
RALPH._] Well, I thought you were either a Paul Pry or a villainous
rascal!

=Ralph.= [_Turns suddenly._] What did you say?

=Dol.= I say we are often mistaken. [_Crosses to R. Aside._] I'll keep
my eyes on you, my fine bird. [=Exit= _R. 2 E._]

=Ralph.= [_Looking around._] Where is Hilda? I did not like the look in
her eye! I must be careful, or she will upset all my plans. She comes.

                        =Enter= _HILDA, R. 2 E._

=Ralph.= You are late!

=Hil.= I am, sir! but not too late for what I have to say. Think you I
will stand calmly by and witness your villainy and allow you to deceive
another as you have basely deceived me? No! If I am not your wife in
law, I am in the sight of Heaven, and I dare you to make another victim.

=Ralph.= [_L., aside._] I must pacify her somehow. [_To HILDA._] Hilda!
[_Takes her hand and leads her to bench L. 3 E._ =Enter= _ADRIENNE in
background R. 5 E. She listens behind statue L. 4 E._] I have repented
saying those harsh words. I did not mean it. It was in anger I spoke.

=Hil.= Oh, Ralph! if I could only believe you.

=Ralph.= You can; and if you could but look into my heart you would
know that you, and you only, are the one for whom its pulses beat.

    _ANASTASIA discovered knitting, seated at table, L. C. CORIOLANUS
    at door, R. 3 E._

=Anas.= Coriolanus, have you ordered the carriage to the station?

=Corio.= Your orders have been obeyed, madam! [_With bow. Crosses to
C._]

=Anas.= Then everything is in readiness for the reception of the bride
and groom. You may retire, Coriolanus, and be pleased to announce them
as soon as they arrive.

=Corio.= I will hold myself in readiness to gratify your desires.
[_Going, aside._] The darling creature! She cannot trust her feelings
when alone in my presence. Every look, every action, speak of the great
admiration she has for me.

=Anas.= Well! [_Impatiently._] Will you go?

=Corio.= I quicken! [=Exit= _D. R. 3 E._]

=Anas.= The stupid dolt, with his stuck-up manners. I hate him! I
wonder whether Mary has attended to the room. [_Goes to door, L. 2
E., and calls._] Mary! Mary! [_MARY answers off entrance_, "Ma'am."]
Have you thoroughly aired Reginald's apartments? [_MARY, as before_,
"Yes, Ma'am." _ANASTASIA closes door._] So! Reginald and his bride will
soon be here, and they will find everything well regulated, thanks to
my personal supervision. I can't say that I like Reginald's choice.
The bold thing, to throw herself upon a man like that, and before
everybody, too! It's outrageous--not a bit of maidenly modesty--I shall
hate her, I know I shall. And Reginald was so pleased to accept the
proud thing. What fools men are! Well, well; I hope the dear boy will
not be disappointed in her and live unhappily. [_She sighs heavily
and resumes knitting._] What a strange thing love is, to be sure. Who
could that stranger have been I met in the garden--such a splendid man!
So full of good sense! So polite! Oh, perfectly lovely! I could fall
in love with such a dear man. [=Enter= _MORRIS MAITLAND, D. R. 2 E._]
I----Morris!

=Mor.= [_C._] Not yet arrived? H'm! The train must be late. Has the
carriage gone?

=Anas.= Yes, brother! I gave Coriolanus strict orders to attend to it!

=Mor.= Well, I suppose they will get here in good time. But it's
getting late--past nine o'clock. [_At table, L. C._] Sister, you will
do all in your power to make Reginald's wife comfortable and receive
her with the respect due the wife of my honored son.

=Anas.= I will do my part, Morris, provided she does hers. But I'm
afraid Reginald has made a poor choice.

=Mor.= Sister, you are prejudiced. Reginald is an honest, sensible and
dutiful son. Although her connections are very aristocratic, more so,
in fact, than I could cordially approve, yet, I have faith in him to
believe that his choice has been wise, and that she will prove an honor
to my son and the pride of his father's heart.

=Anas.= Well, I have no more to say. I hope that she will fulfill your
expectations.

=Mor.= She is now my daughter and shall receive a hearty welcome into
the bosom of our family.

                    =Enter= _CORIOLANUS, D. R. 3 E._

=Corio.= Reginald and Adrienne Maitland! [_MORRIS at L. C.; ANASTASIA
rises and goes to fireplace, L. 3 E._]

    =Enter= _REGINALD, ADRIENNE and HILDA, D. R. 3 E. HILDA, R.,
    ADRIENNE, R. C., REGINALD, C., MORRIS, L. C., ANASTASIA, L._

=Mor.= [_Embracing REGINALD._] My son! welcome to your paternal home.

=Reg.= Father, allow me to bring to you a daughter, my wife. [_Leads
her to him, then crosses to shake hands with ANASTASIA._]

=Mor.= My daughter, welcome to our humble home--receive the blessing
of--

=Adri.= [_Coldly._] Thanks! You honor me. [_Crosses to L._] Reginald,
[_wearily_] I am tired. [_MORRIS retreats painfully. ANASTASIA
exchanges looks with him and draws herself loftily erect._]

=Reg.= Adrienne, my aunt--Miss Maitland.

=Adri.= [_Bows haughtily._] We've met before. [_To REGINALD._] Conduct
me to my room. [_REGINALD bows._ =Exeunt= _ADRIENNE and REGINALD, D.
L. 2 E. HILDA follows with wraps, etc. MORRIS crosses to R. Sinks in
armchair R. of table._]

=Anas.= H'm! I thought so! An iceberg. Proud and dignified. Above such
humble surroundings! Brother!

=Mor.= My son! my son!

=Anas.= Did I not tell you? Perhaps you'll give me credit in the future
for a little sense.

=Mor.= [_Sternly._] Anastasia! Leave me.

=Anas.= Well, you needn't bite my head off because I spoke the truth.
[=Exit= _in dudgeon, D. R. 3 E._]

=Mor.= My fondest expectations blighted. Heaven grant they will be
happy! but--[_shakes his head_] I doubt it--I doubt it.

    =Enter= _REGINALD, D. L. 2 E. He approaches table slowly. MORRIS
    rises and turns away._

=Reg.= Father!

=Mor.= [_Turns suddenly and embraces him._] Oh, my son! I had such
hopes for your future happiness! But alas!

=Reg.= Why, father, can you for a moment doubt it? [_MORRIS shakes his
head._] Adrienne is fatigued--worn out--weary from travel. Our journey
has been extensive. In the morning she will be herself again.

=Mor.= I sincerely hope so, my son! but I fear you have made a great
mistake. You may have loved well, but I fear too unwisely.

=Reg.= Father, you are mistaken in Adrienne. She is all that is
noble--as free from deceit and the taint of the world as a child
unborn. No, no, father! she is all that an honorable man could wish.

=Mor.= For your sake, I wish I could think as you do, but I cannot. Did
she love you as a wife should, she would honor her husband so much as
to show her respect, at least, to his father.

=Reg.= You had a right to expect a warmer acknowledgment of your
welcome. But consider her fatigue. Time will command the respect and
love due her husband's father.

=Mor.= Love is a spontaneous outburst of the heart. It is not of
gradual growth. It takes not time to discover true innate worth in a
person. Love detects it at a glance, and time only confirms the first
impression. My son, is she all that you desire?

=Reg.= Yes, father, all.

=Mor.= And are you sure that she loves you?

=Reg.= [_Confused._] Yes, father--that is--I--

=Mor.= Why this confusion?

=Reg.= I think she does.

=Mor.= Think? Why, did she not tell you as much?

=Reg.= Father, we will not discuss this subject any further. Suffice it
to say that she is my wife, and I have sworn to love and honor her till
death do us part, and I will do my duty, sir!

=Mor.= So be it, my son! and may Providence, who watches over us all,
grant you a happy life. Heaven bless you, my son! [_Clock strikes._]
The hour for retiring is at hand. You will call your wife to attend our
usual family devotion in the library ere retiring for the night.

=Reg.= I attend your pleasure! [=Exit= _D. L. 2 E. MORRIS strikes bell
on table._]

    =Enter= _ANASTASIA, followed by CORIOLANUS, D. R. 3 E. CORIOLANUS
    R., ANASTASIA C., MORRIS L._

=Anas.= Shall I call Reginald's wife?

=Mor.= Reginald has gone to do so.

=Anas.= Oh!

=Mor.= Please retire to the library; I will follow shortly. [=Exit=
_ANASTASIA, followed by CORIOLANUS, D. R. 3 E._]

         =Enter= _REGINALD, D. L. 2 E. MORRIS crosses to R. C._

=Reg.= [_L. C._] Father, Adrienne wishes to be excused; she is too
tired!

=Mor.= My son, you know the laws of this house. All the members of the
family must attend family prayer. This law has ever been kept inviolate
by my ancestors, and it shall not be broken in this instance. You will
inform your wife that I insist upon her attendance. [=Exit= _REGINALD
D. L. 2 E. MORRIS walks the floor._]

    =Enter= _ADRIENNE quickly, D. L. 2 E., followed by REGINALD. She
    crosses to table, L. C. MORRIS R. C._

=Adri.= Sir, in answer to your request, I asked to be excused;
nevertheless, you insist upon a sacrifice of my own inclinations and
desires. In this matter, I wish to inform you, I will suit my own
pleasure. Good-night, sir! [_Going._]

=Mor.= Madam, I respect your desires, and as the wife of my son, I
honor you. But there are certain rules in this household from which
there is no departure, and this is one. From time immemorial has this
custom been a law at our fireside. As you are now a member of our
family, I ask of you, [_ADRIENNE turns away_] nay, I beg of you, be not
the first to violate this rule.

=Adri.= [_Haughtily._] I refuse to comply!

=Mor.= [_Sternly._] Then, madam, you compel me to assert my authority.
As the master of this house, I insist upon your attendance at family
prayer!

=Adri.= [_Drawing herself erect._] Sir!

=Reg.= [_At fire-place._] Father!

=Mor.= Nay! I command you!

=Adri.= [_To REGINALD._] Will you stand by and allow this indignity?

=Reg.= Adrienne--I--

=Mor.= [_Crosses to D. R. 3 E._] Enough! I await your presence in the
library. [=Exit= _D. R. 3 E. ADRIENNE sinks into chair on R. of table.
REGINALD in a pleading attitude. Whistle scene._]


                  =Scene 2=: A STREET IN 1ST GROOVES.

                        =Enter= RALPH, _L. 1 E._

=Ralph.= Confound it, I cannot bear it any longer. This wandering
around, nursing my wrath, is becoming unendurable. After having won
her love, to be snatched from me by that infernal Maitland--curse
him!--and all through that she-devil, Hilda--curse them both! Oh! I
could tear them to pieces!

    =Enter= _HENRY, R. 1 E., in officer's uniform with paper in hand.
    RALPH turns away._

=Hen.= [_Aside._] Ralph Murdell! I never liked the looks of that man.
[_To RALPH._] Hello! Lost your tongue? [_R. C._]

=Ralph.= [_C._] No! but I lost something else!

=Hen.= Lost a love, perhaps?

=Ralph.= No! I've lost my temper!

=Hen.= [_Aside._] Was spooney on Adrienne! [_To RALPH._] Well, I'm glad
you lost it!

=Ralph.= Glad I lost what?

=Hen.= Your temper.

=Ralph.= Oh! I didn't understand.

=Hen.= Why, if you _lost_ your temper, you are well rid of it, and
ought to be jolly. But you look as if you had it still. Ha! ha! ha!

=Ralph.= Confound your jokes; I'm in no humor for levity.

=Hen.= No, I guess not. But where have you kept yourself buried? I have
not seen you since my sister's Grand Ball. I suppose you know she's
married to Maitland?

=Ralph.= Yes! yes! I wish her much joy. What are you doing in that
uniform?

=Hen.= Oh! I've enlisted in the army and was made a recruiting officer.
There is going to be a hot time. The rebels have taken possession of
all the prominent military stations in the South. And when Lincoln
made a call for three hundred thousand volunteers, I could not resist
the desire to do my duty and help preserve the Union. Besides, I was
getting tired of the lazy, drone-like life of society.

=Ralph.= And are you seeking volunteers?

=Hen.= Yes; besides, I am looking up a lot of individuals whose names I
have here.

=Ralph.= Volunteers?

=Hen.= No! The President has ordered a draft to be made for men, and I
am on the look-out for some.

=Ralph.= Have you got me down in the draft?

=Hen.= No! You are one of the lucky ones!

=Ralph.= Indeed! But it would have pleased me if you had. Still, you
can accept me as a volunteer.

=Hen.= [_Aside._] H'm! his disappointment has made him desperate. [_To
RALPH._] You surprise me, Murdell--you have more patriotism than I gave
you credit for.

=Ralph.= This sort of life is too tame for me. I long for excitement!

=Hen.= [_Hands him paper and pencil._] You will please sign here!

=Ralph.= [_Signs paper._] And when shall I report for duty?

=Hen.= To-morrow morning at ten o'clock, at headquarters.

=Ralph.= All right! I'll go and make the necessary preparations. I
shall be on hand. [=Exit= _R. 1 E._]

=Hen.= [_Crosses to L._] I'm glad Adrienne did not marry that chap, for
I did think that she thought a great deal of him. But you can never
tell anything about women. They never do what you think they will.
However, I am more than pleased that things have turned out as they
did. A better or truer man never lived than Reginald Maitland.

    =Enter= _SAMMY and ADOLPHUS arm in arm, R. 1 E. They do not
    perceive HENRY._

=Sam.= I for one am getting discouraged. I've proposed to twenty-three
women in two weeks and been rejected twenty-three times. [_HENRY
examines paper._]

=Adol.= And I've been rejected as many times as I've proposed. If I
only had the courage I'd drown myself.

=Sam.= And if I only had the chance I'd enlist. But come, let us drown
our troubles in a glass of soda water. [_Going towards L. 1 E._]

=Hen.= Halt! [_SAMMY and ADOLPHUS clutch each other in terror._]

 =Sam.=  } Oh! Oh! [_ADOLPHUS and SAMMY C. HENRY L._]
 =Adol.= }

=Hen.= [_To SAMMY._] Your name!

=Sam.= Sammy Dewdrop!

=Hen.= Right! [_To ADOLPHUS._] And yours?

=Adol.= Adolphus Softhead!

=Hen.= Right again! Gentlemen, I am happy to inform you that you have
been drafted! [_SAMMY and ADOLPHUS collapse, terror-stricken._]

=Adol.= Oh! I shall die!

=Sam.= [_Trying to brace up, but shaking like a leaf._] Why don't you
take it bravely like me? [_To ADOLPHUS._]

=Adol.= I can't. I'll never come back alive--I know I shan't.

=Sam.= [_Brightening up suddenly._] I have it. Happy thought. [_To
HENRY._] But they won't take me--I am in the last stage of consumption.
[_Coughs._] And they don't take consumptives.

=Adol.= [_Eagerly._] And I have got--[_Beckons HENRY to come nearer--he
whispers in his ear._]

=Hen.= Very well, gentlemen. If that is so, you are exempt. [_SAMMY and
ADOLPHUS elated, about to go._] Halt! You will first accompany me to
headquarters, where you will be examined by the doctor; and then, if
you are in the condition you say you are, you will be allowed to go.
[_SAMMY and ADOLPHUS get weak in the knees._]

=Sam.= [_To ADOLPHUS._] It's no use, Dolphy, the jig's up!

=Adol.= Why was I born?

=Hen.= About face! Forward, march. [=Exeunt= _all L. 1 E. Whistle
scene._]


              =Scene 3=: OUTSIDE OF THE MAITLAND COTTAGE.

                        =Enter= _HILDA, L. 2 E._

=Hil.= Oh! what shall I do! my mistress is so unhappy. She is pining
away day by day, and all for love for that worthless villain, Ralph.
Oh, if I could only unburden my heart to her and tell her all! If she
only knew how base he is she would not grieve so. Sometimes, when I
see her silent despair, I feel tempted to tell her all. But I promised
to keep silent until I heard from Mr. Dollerclutch. I fear he also has
deserted me. Here comes my mistress! I will avoid her! I cannot witness
her misery--my heart goes out to her. [=Exit= _R. 2 E._]

   =Enter= _ADRIENNE, L. 2 E. She is very pale. Sits on bench R. C._

=Adri.= When will this torture end? Could I but recall the fatal words
that doomed me to a loveless life! I can only blame my impulsive
nature. I knew not what I did--I was mad--and I must suffer the bitter
consequences. Oh, cruel, cruel fate! [_Her head sinks on her arm, which
is resting on back of bench._]

                  =Enter= _MORRIS from cottage on L._

=Mor.= [_At L. C._] Madam!

=Adri.= [_Starts and rises haughtily._] Your pleasure, sir!

=Mor.= There is a matter I wish to speak to you about.

=Adri.= Proceed, sir!

=Mor.= It is about my son. [_ADRIENNE braces herself._] Until your
advent into our family all was peace and sunshine; but now all is
mystery and clouds. And you, madam, are the cause of this condition of
affairs. [_ADRIENNE presses her hand to her heart._] I speak in behalf
of my son. Since his marriage to you I have noted a change in him.
There is something weighing heavily on his mind.

=Adri.= And has _he_ sent you to plead his cause?

=Mor.= No, madam! He has defended you in every particular; he has tried
to hide the true state of affairs. His sense of honor is so high that
he would not listen to a word against your action. His vow at the altar
is sacred to him; he would suffer anything without a murmur, and he
will ever defend his wife from the sneers of the world.

=Adri.= Will you enlighten me, sir, as to the nature of my offense?

=Mor.= You have destroyed the happiness of my son's life. He cannot
hide the disappointment of his honest heart from the searching gaze of
a father.

=Adri.= Sir! It is best that we understand each other. I decline
further to listen to your upbraidings. You have no right to question
my actions. I forbid you ever to broach this subject again. The die is
cast. I know my duty as a wife; and to my husband, and to him alone,
will I hold myself accountable for my actions. [=Exit= _majestically L.
2 E. MORRIS looks after her._]

                      =Enter= _ANASTASIA, R. 2 E._

=Anas.= Brother Morris, I'll not put up with it any longer. Things are
getting to be in a pretty strait when a person of my standing must
submit to such snubbing--yes, brother, I repeat, _snubbing_.

=Mor.= Don't bother me! [=Exit= _into cottage._]

                    =Enter= _DOLLERCLUTCH, gate C._

=Anas.= [_Looking after MORRIS, angrily._] Well, I never! another snub!

=Dol.= [_Down R._] Ahem!

=Anas.= [_Turns suddenly._] There's that sweet man again. [_She affects
shyness._]

=Dol.= I beg your pardon, madam! but allow me to express my pleasure in
being so fortunate as to meet your lovely self under such auspicious
circumstances.

=Anas.= You flatter me!

=Dol.= By no means, madam!--by no means. That is something I would not
be guilty of. What I said came from the heart, madam--from the heart!
Do you understand?

=Anas.= I think I do, sir! [_Aside._] Perfectly captivating!

=Dol.= Allow me to conduct you to a seat, you are tired standing. [_He
leads her to bench R. C. They sit at each end of bench and gradually
move up closer to each other during the subsequent dialogue. Comic
business._]

=Anas.= [_Aside._] I believe he is going to propose! If he does, I'll
accept him on the instant.

=Dol.= [_Fidgeting._] Madam, I--I--really I have not the pleasure of
your name.

=Anas.= Anastasia Maitland, sir!

=Dol.= Anastasia! What a beautiful name!

=Anas.= Thank you!

=Dol.= And so appropriate to your charming self. It will always remind
me of an angel.

=Anas.= Did you ever see an angel?

=Dol.= Yes, many a one--but they were all painted!

=Anas.= Oh! But I really forgot what you said your name was!

=Dol.= George Washington Dollerclutch, at your service, madam! You may
call me Father of my Country Dollerclutch for short.

=Anas.= Such a grand name! It is so poetical!

=Dol.= [_Nudges up closer._] Ahem!

=Anas.= [_Aside._] The declaration is coming! I will fall in his arms
as soon as he makes it.

=Dol.= Madam--I--I--[_Pulls out baby dress instead of handkerchief and
wipes his face._]

=Anas.= My heart goes pitti-di-pat! [_Sees baby dress._] Oh! [_She
turns away._]

=Dol.= [_Notices it for the first time. Aside._] Confound it! I thought
I had my handkerchief. [_To ANASTASIA._] I beg your pardon, madam!
[_Puts it away and gets his handkerchief. ANASTASIA smiles sweetly and
bows her head._] Ahem! as I was going to say--

                     =Enter= _CORIOLANUS, L. 2 E._

=Dol.= You are--you are--[_Sees CORIOLANUS._] The devil! [_Starts
up. CORIOLANUS holds himself proudly erect. ANASTASIA_ =Exits= _with
dignity into cottage._]

=Cor.= [_Aside._] A rival?

=Dol.= Playing the eavesdropper, eh! [_Aside._] I'll bounce the rascal!
[_Leaps upon him suddenly and runs him off R. 2 E._] I'll teach you
better manners. [_Walks down stage._]

                        =Enter= _HILDA, R. 2 E._

=Dol.= Don't come back or I'll--[_Sees HILDA._] Oh!

=Hil.= [_Comes forward quickly._] Oh, sir! You have come at last. What
news have you--is it good or bad?

=Dol.= My dear child, I have both good and bad. I have searched the
church register, but found no record of the marriage.

=Hil.= Alas! Then I have no hope. [_Sobs._]

=Dol.= [_Pulls out handkerchief._] Now don't you cry--if you do I'll
throw up the case. [_She continues to sob._] Didn't I tell you my news
was both good and bad?

=Hil.= [_Looks up hopefully._] Yes! Yes!

=Dol.= But I found that about the time you were married a leaf was torn
out--and I'll stake my life that it was the record of your marriage.

=Hil.= But who could have done such a thing?

=Dol.= I strongly suspect that infernal villain of a husband of yours,
to hide the evidence of your marriage to him!

=Hil.= Then I am lost! for he surely must have destroyed it. Oh, what
shall I do--what shall I do!

=Dol.= Shut up! If you get me all excited, I'll have nothing to do
with it. I don't believe he has destroyed it at all, but has it in his
possession. I'm going to do a little detective work, and I warrant you
that I'll spare no money to gain my point. I said I'd see this thing
through, and hang me if I don't go my length in it.

=Hil.= Oh, thank you, sir!

=Dol.= Now listen to my plan. [_Noise heard, L. 2 E._]

=Hil.= Some one approaches! Let us walk on a piece, where there is no
danger of being overheard. [=Exeunt= _HILDA and DOLLERCLUTCH, R. 2 E._]

           =Enter= _ANASTASIA, L. 2 E., with letter in hand._

=Anas.= [_Looks around._] I have written a few lines to the dear man,
just to encourage him a bit--he seemed so confused. I will leave it
here on this bench. [_Lays it on bench R. C._] He will surely come back
and find it. George Washington Dollerclutch! Oh! he must be a brave man
to have such a grand name! [_Noise heard, R. 2 E._] I hear footsteps!
It must be he returning--I'll retire for a few moments. [=Exit= _L. 2
E._]

                     =Enter= _CORIOLANUS, R. 2 E._

=Cor.= How dare he lay violent hands upon me--a gentleman of nobility!
I cannot suffer such indignity to pass unnoticed. [_Sees letter on
bench._] What's this! a letter?--and her handwriting, too! [_Reads._]
"To one I love"--hem! that's me! [_Opens it--reads._] "Thou adorable
one with the brave sounding name,"--she likes my name! "Ever since
our first meeting have you made the profoundest impression upon my
heart."--I knew it! "Maidenly modesty has prevented me from making an
open expression of my affection. My heart expands within my bosom. If
you love me wear a red necktie and smile upon me when next we meet.
With all maidenly reserve, I am yours, A. M." I will procure the
necktie at once, and prepare to satisfy the longing of her heart with
the knowledge that her love is returned. [=Exit= _CORIOLANUS, L. 2 E._]

                        =Enter= _HENRY, gate C._

=Hen.= [_With draft in hand._] I think I have secured all the
persons in the draft but two, and they are Coriolanus Wellington and
George Washington Dollerclutch. That Dollerclutch has led me quite a
chase--been looking for him two days. Wherever I've looked for him I
was informed he had just left. I believe the rascal is dodging me. But
I guess I'm sure of the other chap--he's a servant here with Adrienne's
father-in-law. I'll go in and secure him. [=Exit= _into cottage._]

               =Enter= _DOLLERCLUTCH and HILDA, R. 2 E._

=Dol.= Now you leave everything in my hands and I'll see that I bring
you through your trouble all right. I've got all the points on this
paper. Now go into the house before we are discovered. I'll soon bring
the smiles back again.

=Hil.= Oh, thank you! Heaven bless you for befriending a helpless girl.
[=Exit= _HILDA into cottage._]

    =Enter= _ANASTASIA, L. 2 E. DOLLERCLUTCH puts paper into pocket._

=Anas.= [_Aside._] He has just read my letter. Ahem!

=Dol.= [_Turns._] My dear madam! Pray be seated! [_Leads her to bench
R. C._] I regret extremely that our last interview was so abruptly
terminated by the advent of that ignorant jackass--

    =Enter= _CORIOLANUS, L. 2 E., wearing a ridiculously large red
    necktie. He strikes dignified attitudes and tries to attract
    ANASTASIA'S attention to it. He tries to smile--but they are very
    sickly smiles._

=Anas.= [_Stares at CORIOLANUS._] Oh!

=Dol.= [_Aside._] There's that confounded idiot again. Look at the
grinning hyena.

=Anas.= Well, I never! The man must be crazy.

=Dol.= [_Rising._] Madam! with your permission, I will crush the
rascal. [_ANASTASIA nods assent. DOLLERCLUTCH bounces him--they
struggle off L. 2 E. Sound of broken glass. DOLLERCLUTCH returns, his
clothes ruffled._] I guess I fixed him that time--I landed him in the
hot-house.

=Anas.= [_Admiringly._] I knew you were a brave man!

=Dol.= Well, I must say I am rather proud of my bravery. I was not
named George Washington for nothing.

                     =Enter= _HENRY from cottage._

=Hen.= [_Aside._] At last! [_To DOLLERCLUTCH._] George Washington
Dollerclutch, I beg to inform you that you are drafted. You will
accompany me to headquarters.

=Dol.= [_Terror-stricken._] Oh, Lord!

    =Enter= _CORIOLANUS, L. 2 E., face and hands cut--his clothes
    disordered. ANASTASIA R., DOLLERCLUTCH R. C., HENRY C., CORIOLANUS
    L. C._

=Cor.= What! I calmly submit to this outrage? Never! I'll tear him to
pieces.

=Hen.= [_Seizing CORIOLANUS._] You are drafted to help preserve
the Union. [_CORIOLANUS is frightened. During the above ANASTASIA
pantomimes to DOLLERCLUTCH to follow her and escape._ =Exit= _ANASTASIA
R. 2 E. DOLLERCLUTCH about to follow her. HENRY sees him and points
revolver at him._] Halt! [_DOLLERCLUTCH turns and sees revolver and is
frightened._] Advance three paces--halt! About face! [_CORIOLANUS takes
position on his right._] That will do. Now, gentlemen, before we go to
headquarters, you will accompany me into the house until I get some
lunch; then we will proceed on our journey. Left face! Forward march!
[=Exeunt= _all into cottage._]

           =Enter= _ADRIENNE, followed by REGINALD, L. 2 E._

=Reg.= Adrienne!

=Adri.= [_R. C. Turns._] Your pleasure, Reginald!

=Reg.= [_Quietly, but firmly._] Adrienne, I desire a few moments'
conversation. What I have to say is for your ears only!

=Adri.= Proceed, Reginald. I hear you!

=Reg.= Adrienne, the time has come when I must speak--I can no longer
bear the cold, dignified reserve with which you treat me--your husband.
There is a motive for all things--and there must be a motive that
prompts your action. We are man and wife, and open candor and frankness
should exist between us.

=Adri.= Have I not fulfilled my duty, sir? Have I not shown you the
honor and respect that you have a right to demand from a wife?

=Reg.= You have honored and respected me, Adrienne, but I have a right
to expect even more.

=Adri.= I do not understand!

=Reg.= I have a right to expect your love! [_ADRIENNE retreats a step,
her hand pressed to her heart._] Yes, Adrienne! Marriage is a holy act
which ought to be based on the rock of love; else it becomes a sordid
and disgraceful bargain, devoid of sacredness and heavenly sanction.
[_She recoils._] When I led you to the altar it was with the firm
belief that our marriage would be a holy and sacred bond, founded upon
the eternal principle of love. But your manner since has caused me to
doubt the sincerity of your heart.

=Adri.= [_Haughtily._] Did I, when I accepted your hand, say that I
returned your love?

=Reg.= No! In my eyes you were an ideal woman, of the highest and
noblest sentiment--devoid of worldly ambition and desire. That was
sufficient. Could I then doubt the feeling which actuated your
acceptance of my heart and hand? [_Slight pause._] Adrienne! say that I
am not disappointed in you--say that your sacred vow at the altar, "to
love, honor and obey," was not a hollow sham--speak, Adrienne, speak!
[_Pause. REGINALD turns away._]

=Adri.= [_Recovering slowly._] I will be honest with you, sir! You have
a right to know. Could I but recall those fatal words that bound me for
life to one I can never love, I would willingly lay down my life. I
refused you when you first offered yourself, because I loved another.
When I witnessed his perfidy, a few moments later, in a fit of pique,
I accepted you. When I recovered from the mad impulse that swayed my
being, I awakened to the misery into which I had plunged myself, and I
almost hated you for tempting me to this agonizing bondage.

=Reg.= [_With intense feeling suppressed._] Madam, the die is cast! You
bear my name--you are my wife--that cannot be recalled, for that is
recorded above. You will ever receive at my hands the respect that is
due my wife. I shall provide for and protect you as long as He, in His
good mercy, does grant me life. You will always find this, my paternal
home, yours to enjoy.

=Adri.= [_Alarmed._] What would you do?

=Reg.= Madam, it must be evident to you that my hopes in life are
blighted; that I would not weary your sight with the presence of one
who would be a constant reproach to your misery and folly. I will
leave you. Perhaps the day may come when your heart may change and
turn toward the husband. If so, the words, "Reginald, I love you--come
back," will bring to your bosom the husband, who will always be true to
his sacred vow at the altar. [_Crosses to L._]

for the preservation of the Union and protect the Stars and Stripes.

ACT III.

A Lapse of Four Years.


                     =Scene 1=: A CAMP IN THE ARMY.

    _Discovered at rise of curtain: HENRY in Captain's uniform,
    and REGINALD as a private, both seated on camp-stools, R. 2 E.
    CORIOLANUS, as private, sitting near the fire, R. C. DOLLERCLUTCH,
    as private, asleep in front of tent, L. 4 E. ADOLPHUS, as private,
    doing sentinel duty, L. 1 E._

=Hen.= When did you hear from home last, Reginald?

=Reg.= A week ago.

=Hen.= And how is your little Alice?

=Reg.= When last I heard, she was well. Oh, Henry! she is the only joy
in my life. The future of my child is the only thing that keeps me
from despair. I live in hopes that I shall one day clasp my child to
my bosom. Oh, the yearning of a father's heart! And now that we are so
near to her, I almost feel tempted to shirk my duty and satisfy the
longing to see my beloved child.

=Hen.= We are only six miles away from your home, I believe you said?

=Reg.= Yes! day by day have we been drawing closer to it. And it is
nearly four years since I left the scene, never to return to it again.
[_He turns away._]

=Hen.= Reginald, I sincerely sympathize with you in your trouble.
[_Takes him by the hand._] Adrienne has wronged you deeply. She----

=Reg.= [_Checks him._] Henry, she is your sister, but do not forget
that she is my _wife_. I cannot listen to her condemnation even from
you.

=Hen.= Well, Reginald, I respect your wishes. But cheer up! I have
faith to believe that all will be right again--that some day will see
you reunited and happy.

=Reg.= [_Shakes his head._] This will be my only happiness, Henry.
[_Shows picture of child._]

=Hen.= Is this the picture of my niece? Why, she doesn't look a bit
like Adrienne!

=Reg.= No! the resemblance is to _my_ family. I can now readily
understand why my father wrote to me, soon after the child's birth,
asking the privilege of naming it. She bears a striking resemblance to
my little sister.

=Hen.= Your sister! I never knew you had a sister!

=Reg.= No! because that is the skeleton in our family closet. Her name
was Alice. When but three months old she was stolen from the cradle.
All effort to recover the child proved fruitless. Her disappearance has
since remained a mystery. Grief over our loss brought my mother to an
early grave. My father sacrificed his all in the hope of recovering the
child, but all his efforts proved unavailing. This happened eighteen
years ago, and we know not whether she be living or not, but we mourn
her as dead.

=Hen.= And had you no suspicion as to who stole the child?

=Reg.= None. My father did not think he had an enemy in the world.

=Hen.= Strange! very strange! The ways of Providence are mysterious,
and we must bow with resignation to His Divine Will. One moment,
Reginald. [_To ADOLPHUS._] Adolphus!

=Adol.= [_Salutes._] Captain, I await your orders.

=Hen.= Go to the officers' tent and inquire whether the mail has
arrived.

=Adol.= [_Salutes._] All right, Captain! [=Exit= _L. 1 E._]

=Hen.= [_To CORIOLANUS._] Coriolanus! [_CORIOLANUS rises and salutes._]
Take his post as sentinel! [_CORIOLANUS salutes and takes his post. To
REGINALD._] It is remarkable what a change there is in Adolphus. When I
drafted him I thought he would make a poor soldier, he was so cowardly;
but he has turned out to be one of the bravest men in the regiment. A
soldier's life has made a man of him.

=Reg.= It has, indeed! I have often wanted to ask you what ever became
of his chum, Sammy. I thought you had drafted him, also.

=Hen.= I did; but he had plenty of money, and furnished a substitute. I
wish the mail would arrive. [_Rises._] By the way, Reginald, did your
last letter mention anything about any of the rest of your household?

=Reg.= [_Rises._] For instance, Hilda? Ha! ha! ha! Oh, you sly rogue!
Henry, I remember a conversation we had, when you asked me to show you
a woman devoid of fashion's frivolities--ha! ha! ha! Perhaps, now _you_
can show one--ha! ha! ha! What! Henry, the recluse, the woman-hater, in
love with a woman? Wonderful! Ha! ha! ha!

=Hen.= Well, I'll acknowledge the corn; but I didn't know a sensible
woman until I met Hilda Wallace, whose quiet and unassuming manners
struck the chord of affinity in my nature.

=Reg.= [_Takes him by the hand._] Well, well, I'm glad of the
transformation, and I hope your future will not be marred by
disappointment. [_DOLLERCLUTCH snores._]

                      =Enter= _ADOLPHUS, L. 1 E._

=Hen.= [_To ADOLPHUS._] Well?

=Adol.= [_Salutes._] The mail has not arrived, Captain! [REGINALD
=Exits= _into tent, C. DOLLERCLUTCH snores._]

=Hen.= Pshaw! just tickle that fellow with your boot! [_ADOLPHUS about
to do so._]

=Dol.= [_Dreaming._] Oh, Anastasia! [_ADOLPHUS, L. C. HENRY, C.
DOLLERCLUTCH asleep, L. CORIOLANUS, down L._]

=Hen.= Listen! He's dreaming!

=Dol.= Anastasia, beloved! oh, fly--fly to my arms!

=Hen.= Ha! ha! ha! I wonder whether she's got wings? [_DOLLERCLUTCH
talks again._] But, listen!

=Dol.= [_Starting._] The rebs are coming--the rebs are coming! Where
shall I hide myself? I'll be killed if I stay here. [_Sits upright._]
Don't shoot! [_He fights imaginary rebels._] Don't shoot--don't!
[_Awakes._]

=Hen.= Look out! the rebs are coming! Ha! ha! ha!

=Dol.= [_Getting on his feet. Aside._] Confound it all! I must have
been dreaming.

=Hen.= Ha! ha! ha! We've found you out at last, old Dollerclutch. You
are a _brave_ man, George Washington. I thought I never did see you
when we went into an engagement--now I can account for it.

=Dol.= [_L. C._] Sir! I have always been where the fight was thickest.

=Cor.= [_Aside._] After it was over.

=Hen.= _You_ mean George Washington was--but I mean George Washington
Dollerclutch.

=Dol.= Sir! Do you mean to insinuate that my bravery is a matter of
doubt? You wrong me, sir! You wrong me, I can assure you. My deeds of
valor have saved the day many a time--many a time. Do you understand?
But my modesty won't allow me to speak of them. Even in my childhood
was I noted for my bravery. I took Mrs. Winslow's soothing syrup with
the most unflinching courage. Nothing would delight me more than a
hand-to-hand encounter with a whole regiment of rebels. I would glory
in the chance, sir! I have smelt powder many times. [_He shoots off his
revolver, smells the smoke from the barrel, and struts the stage. HENRY
whispers to ADOLPHUS and points to DOLLERCLUTCH._]

=Adol.= [_Aside to HENRY._] All right, captain; I understand! [_He
steals off cautiously, L. 2 E. HENRY beckons to CORIOLANUS to
follow him, enjoining caution._ =Exeunt=, _R. 2 E. All this is done
unperceived by DOLLERCLUTCH._]

=Dol.= To take me for a coward--bah! Gentlemen, you don't know!
you--[_Turns and finds them gone._] Hello! where the deuce did they go?
[_Looks around in the different tents._]

    =Enter= _ADOLPHUS, L. 2 E., in a rebel suit, with gun and false
    whiskers. He is not noticed by DOLLERCLUTCH. ADOLPHUS brings his
    gun to shoulder and points it at DOLLERCLUTCH._

=Adol.= [_L. C._] Halt, and surrender. [_DOLLERCLUTCH at tent, R. 5 E.
He turns suddenly in a fright--his knees knock together--he raises his
hands and tries to speak._] Don't move a muscle or I'll bore you.

=Dol.= [_C._] Don't shoot! Oh, please don't shoot. Please, Mr. Rebel,
I have sixteen small children. Oh! consider what will become of them
when I am taken from them! [_ADOLPHUS drops his gun. Aside._] Ah! that
melted him! [_ADOLPHUS raises gun again._] Oh! oh!

=Adol.= Remove your cap! [_DOLLERCLUTCH complies with all._] Place it
on the ground. Take off your coat. Place it with your cap! [_ADOLPHUS
takes off his cap and throws it to him._] Put it on! [_Takes off
his coat and throws it to DOLLERCLUTCH._] Put it on! [_He gathers
up DOLLERCLUTCH'S clothes._] Now sit down. [_DOLLERCLUTCH goes for
stool._] No, no, on the ground! Take hold of your toes! Now sit there
till I come back. [=Exit= _L. 2 E._]

=Dol.= [_Looking around._] This is the toughest scrape I was ever in.
The camp has been surprised by the rebels. They are all captured. Oh,
Anastasia, I'm done for!

    =Enter= _HENRY, R. 4 E., followed by CORIOLANUS. ADOLPHUS
    re-enters, L. 2 E., in his regular uniform._

=Hen.= [_CORIOLANUS R., HENRY R. C., DOLLERCLUTCH C., ADOLPHUS L. C.
Pounces upon DOLLERCLUTCH._] I've got the rebel, boys. Get some cords,
quick! [_ADOLPHUS gets them, L. 3 E._]

=Dol.= [_Struggling._] Hold on, Captain! Let me go; it's me!

=Corio.= Let's hang the rebel to a tree, Captain! He's a spy!

=Dol.= I tell you, Captain, it's me--don't you hear me?

=Adol.= Let's tie him to a stake and riddle him with bullets.

=Corio.= [_Aside._] I'll get even with him now for the indignity he
heaped upon me four years ago.

=Dol.= [_Struggling._] Oh!

=Hen.= I'll tell you what we'll do! We will give him a sound switching
first. Then we'll hang him for a spy.

=Corio.= [_Eagerly._] Let me do the switching, Captain. [_Gets switch,
L. 3 E. Aside._] I'll give it him hot!

=Dol.= Oh, Lord! I shall die! [_CORIOLANUS returns._]

=Corio.= Now, you rebel, [_cuts him with switch_] how does that feel?

=Dol.= You infernal rascal! I'll--[_CORIOLANUS cuts him again._] Oh!

=Corio.= Fits close, eh? [_Cuts again._]

=Dol.= [_Struggling._] Oh! oh! [_Pleads._] Good Coriolanus,
please--please don't! [_CORIOLANUS cuts again._] Oh! Don't you know
your old friend, Dollerclutch?

=Corio.= Dollerclutch? You? Oh, no! you're not Dollerclutch.
Dollerclutch is a _brave_ man. Oh, no! you're a black-hearted rebel.
[_Cuts him again._]

=Dol.= Oh! oh!

=Hen.= [_To CORIOLANUS._] Hold! Let me look at him! Ha! ha! ha! It is
Dollerclutch, by all that's wonderful! [_Releases DOLLERCLUTCH._] Ha!
ha! ha! a good joke!

=Dol.= [_Rises to his feet._] A joke, sir? Do you call that a joke?
But, I'll now give you an exhibition of my bravery, sir! [_Pounces
suddenly upon CORIOLANUS. They struggle off, L. 3 E. All laugh._]

=Adol.= I guess we've taken the conceit out of him, Captain!

=Hen.= Yes, I hope it will prove a wholesome lesson to him.

    =Enter= _RALPH, L. 2 E., with letters, which he pulls from his
    pocket. A large wallet drops unnoticed by him from his pocket, near
    stool, L. 2 E._

=Ralph.= [_C._] Good afternoon, Henry!

=Hen.= [_Aside._] The mail at last! [_To RALPH._] Good afternoon,
Murdell! The mail?

=Ralph.= [_R. C._] Yes! [_Sorting letters._] Any news from the front?

=Hen.= Yes! Grant has flanked Lee and is pressing him hard.

=Ralph.= Good! He'll worry him out soon. [_Hands letter to HENRY._]

        =Re-enter= _DOLLERCLUTCH, L. 3 E.; CORIOLANUS, L. 2 E._

=Hen.= Thanks, Major! [_Retires up stage and reads letter._]

=Ralph.= [_Reads from envelope._] Adolphus Softhead!

=Adol.= [_Comes forward._] Thank you, Major! [_Salutes, and retires up
stage reading._]

=Ralph.= [_As before._] George Washington Dollerclutch.

=Dol.= [_Comes down._] That's me, Major! [_He takes letter, salutes and
sits on stool, near which pocket-book lies._]

                     =Enter= _REGINALD, from tent._

=Reg.= [_R. C., to RALPH._] Anything for me, Major? [_Salutes._]

=Ralph.= [_Coldly._] Yes! [_Hands him letter._]

=Reg.= Thank you, Major! [_Salutes and retires up stage reading._]

=Ralph.= [_Looking after him._] Curse him! How I hate him! The proud
fool! Satisfied to remain a private! If he'd accepted promotion, as
it was offered him from time to time, for his gallant bravery in the
field, he would be my superior officer. As it is, he prefers to remain
a private, because, as he says, his ambition does not aspire to receive
the plaudits of his country. The commanding officers cannot find praise
enough for his heroism in action. Curse him! [_To HENRY on right._]
Lowville, you will meet the officers in a half hour from now, for
consultation.

=Hen.= All right, Major! [=Exit= _RALPH, L. 2 E._]

=Reg.= [_Looking at letter._] And yet no word from Adrienne! [=Exit=
_into tent, R. 5 E._]

=Dol.= [_At stool, L. 2 E., reads._] "I long for the time when this
cruel war is over, when I may receive my brave Dollerclutch to this
maiden heart." Oh! this cruel war, to keep such fond hearts apart!
Hello! Here is something on the other side--[_reads._] "Hilda tells me
to write you that she has not forgotten you, and God bless you!" No,
nor have I forgotten her! Poor girl! I've watched him and pumped him,
but I can't find out anything--he's as close as an oyster with--[_Sees
wallet on ground._] Hello! What's this? [_Picks it up._] "R. M." Why,
it's his! [_Looks around._] H'm! I'll investigate! [_Opens it and
pulls out papers. He unfolds one and jumps up excitedly._] Hurrah!
Hilda's marriage record, by the jumping jingo! [_He looks around,
places it in his pocket._] Good! [_Unfolds another._] H'm--'tis part of
a letter--[_reads_] "of old Maitland"--something torn off and then--"of
old Maitland"--[_reads further_] "Revenge is sweet. I can fancy how he
grieves for his lost Alice!" [_Studies._] Maitland! The devil! That's
Reginald's name; but he says old Maitland--he's young; but he's got
a father. Of course he has, and he's older than he. Certainly he is!
How stupid I am! [_Studies again._] H'm! [_Pulls out baby dress from
his bosom and examines initials._] A. M.! [_Jumps up._] Eureka! by the
jumping jingo! A.--Alice! M.--Maitland! That's Hilda's name, I'll stake
my life! Here comes the rascal back. [_DOLLERCLUTCH puts letter in his
pocket hastily--he leaves the wallet on the ground, where he found
it--goes a little up stage and appears interested in his own letter._]

         =Enter= _RALPH, L. 2 E., as if hunting for something._

=Ralph.= Confound it! I must have dropped it when I pulled those
letters from my pocket! [_Sees wallet on ground._] Ah! Here it is!
safe! What a fortunate thing it did not fall into anybody's hands!
Good! I'm a lucky dog! [=Exit= _L. 2 E._]

=Dol.= [_Comes down and looks after him._] Yes! and I'm a luckier dog.
I can go you one better, my chap. George Washington, you did that
slick--you're a trump! But how shall I get these papers to the poor
girl? Confound it, I can't send them to her for fear they'll fall
into his hands again. If I keep them he'll soon discover his loss and
institute a search. If I hide them until the war is over, I might get
shot by an infernal rebel, and then how will the poor girl know about
them? Now, this _is_ a dilemma! [_Studies._] I have it! It is only
five or six miles to the place. I'll take them myself. I'll wait till
dark, then I'll slip away. I can be back in three hours! [_Sudden
thought._] What if my absence should be discovered? Then I'll be in
a pretty pickle! Court-martial--probably shot for a deserter. Ugh!
[_Sudden determination._] I'll risk it; I promised to see this thing
through, and, hang it, George Washington Dollerclutch will stand by his
word. Besides, I'll have a chance to see my charming Anastasia. That'll
nerve me in the undertaking. [_Retires up stage and_ =Exits= _into
tent, L. 4 E. During the last speech the stage is gradually darkened.
HENRY comes forward, C._]

=Hen.= Dollerclutch! [_DOLLERCLUTCH sticks his head out of tent._]
You will serve as sentinel on the high rock for the night. Maitland,
relieve Softhead. [_They salute and go to their respective posts.
DOLLERCLUTCH on high rock, L. 5 E. REGINALD, L. 1 E._] This is going to
be a dark night. I'll turn in. [=Exit= _HENRY, L. 2 E. The rest retire
to their tents._]

=Dol.= Now for my journey! [_He comes down, gets a cloak from tent, L.
4 E., and steals away cautiously, R. 3 E._]

=Reg.= [_L. C. In a study._] "Adrienne has taught little Alice to pray
for you." How strangely my father's words move me! Perhaps--but no!
no!--that will never be! Adrienne must be forever dead to my yearning
heart. When I entered the army I thought I had buried the joy of life
forever. But love for my child has sprung from the ashes of my forlorn
hopes, to cheer my drooping heart, like the oasis to the weary traveler
of the desert. Oh! the longing of a father's heart! What would I not
give to see her--speak to her. Oh! I feel as if I could not resist the
temptation to go and have if but one look. Yes, yes--a soldier's life
is uncertain--it may be the only opportunity to cast my eyes upon my
darling Alice!

           =Enter= _RALPH, L. 2 E. He pauses. REGINALD at C._

=Reg.= I cannot resist the impulse. I must see my child! [=Exit=
_hurriedly into tent, L. 5 E. RALPH watches him cautiously._]

    =Re-enter= _REGINALD from tent with cloak, and_ =Exit= _hurriedly,
    R. 4 E._

=Ralph.= What does this mean? Maitland leaving his post? He acts
strangely, too! I'll follow him and see what he is up to. At last I
have the opportunity to humble his pride in the sight of the commanding
officers! [_He follows REGINALD, R. 4 E._]

                            =Quick Curtain.=




Act IV.


            =Scene 1=: SITTING-ROOM IN THE MAITLAND COTTAGE.

         _ANASTASIA discovered seated knitting at table, L. C._

=Anas.= War, and war, and war--and nothing but war! What earthly sense
can there be in a lot of men standing up to be shot at, I'd like to
know? Men making targets of themselves for others to practice shooting
at! If they want to shoot so bad there are enough shooting galleries,
where they can bang away to their hearts' content. But that's just the
way with the men. They always will be doing things they ought not to.
If the women only had the control of the Government, there would not be
any war--never! Everything would be peace and harmony.

                      =Enter= _MORRIS, D. R. 3 E._

=Mor.= [_R. C._] Good morning, sister! Where is my little darling Alice?

=Anas.= Out in the garden with her mother and Hilda.

=Mor.= [_Anxiously._] I am almost afraid to let them venture out of the
house for fear there might be some rebels lurking in the neighborhood.

=Anas.= [_Drops knitting and rises._] Good gracious, brother Morris!
There is no danger of the fighting coming so close?

=Mor.= It is hard to tell how it will be. Warfare is very uncertain,
although I do not think there is any immediate danger. The rebels are
fleeing towards the north-west, out of our track entirely. The Union
forces are but six miles to our west.

=Anas.= What if they should turn back? What will become of us?

=Mor.= True; but I believe the greatest danger is past! The rebels have
a determined pursuer, who will not be forced back. Grant is not the
man to acknowledge defeat. He has entered the fight to win, and I have
faith in him to believe that he will not turn his back upon the rebels
until he has forced them to submission.

=Anas.= Just to think that we might all have been shot and cut up--ugh!
It makes my blood run cold.

=Mor.= But the danger is not entirely over. The enemy is getting
desperate. Their supplies are cut off, and I fear some depredation
from foraging parties. I must caution them not to go out of sight of
the house, and not to allow Alice out of hearing. It would tear my
heart-strings should harm come to my darling little Alice.

=Anas.= Bless the sweet child! How she does grow. Ah! brother, she
looks more and more like our poor lost Alice every day.

=Mor.= Anastasia! I beg of you do not re-open the old wound. Revive not
the bitter memories of the past, which still have power to renew the
agony of a father's woful loss. [_Turns away._]

=Anas.= Forgive me, brother! I did not wish to make you feel sad. I'm
too sympathetic--I'm--I'm--[_She sits and cries affectedly._]

=Mor.= There, there! Don't let us have a scene. John is about ready to
start for the post-office. If you have any letters to send, you will
please have them ready. I will go and seek my little torment, Alice.
[=Exit= _D. R. F._]

=Anas.= [_Takes letter from pocket and reads it._] Ah, how he loves
the child! Should anything happen to Alice, it would kill him.
[_Addresses letter._] George Washington Dollerclutch, Esq. There,
you brave man! I'm so afraid his lion courage will make him too
venturesome. History will be full of his great deeds of bravery and
valor. But I must hasten, or I shall be too late. [=Exit= _D. L. 2 E._]

       =Enter= _HILDA, D. R. 3 E. She goes to chair R. of table._

=Hil.= How cruel is fate! The friend on whom I had based my hopes to
help me sustain an honorable recognition before the world is debarred,
by the cruel requirements of war, from clearing my name of the stain
and reproach heaped upon it by a designing and depraved villain.

                     =Enter= _ADRIENNE, D. R. 3 E._

=Adri.= What! brooding again, Hilda? Come, cheer up! Put a firm trust
in the Almighty, and He will help you out of your great trouble.

=Hil.= I do! [_Rises._] But, oh! it seems so long to wait!

=Adri.= Alas, yes! We are apt to question sometimes, if He has deserted
us. But, rest assured, Hilda, He is all mercy and justice, and will, in
His good time, bring the balm of peace and joy to the suffering heart.

=Hil.= Thanks, my lady! You have been so good to me.

=Adri.= Nay, Hilda! I deeply sympathize with you in your trouble, and
I feel assured that your villainous husband will, some day, meet the
punishment he so richly deserves.

=Hil.= Yes, my lady. How near he came to wrecking your happiness, also.
It makes me shudder to think of it.

=Adri.= Yes, Hilda! but Heaven saved me from such a fate. It is with
shame that I must acknowledge that I was so blinded to his real
character as to love him. Thank Heaven, my eyes have been opened to his
treachery and baseness.

=Hil.= Oh, my lady! I am so glad to know that you forgave my silence
about his true character.

=Adri.= I could not blame you, Hilda. It was a bitter lesson, and I
can only reproach my folly for listening to his ardent appeals of
love. I thought him a gentleman of the highest honor, worthy of the
love of a virtuous and innocent girl. But your exposure of his utter
depravity has saved me from despair. It has awakened me to a keen
sense of the great injustice I have done him who has honored me with
his name--my husband. Oh, the agony I have inflicted upon that noble,
trusting heart! Oh, that it was I that drove him from me by my wretched
cruelty!--perhaps to meet his death upon the gory field of battle.

         =Enter= _MORRIS, door in L. F. He pauses and listens._

=Adri.= Oh, may the Heavenly Father spare his life and bring him safely
back to this bleeding heart.

=Hil.= Oh, Adrienne! then you love him?

=Adri.= Love him, Hilda! Yea. I worship him. The grand nobility of his
soul has inspired my heart with the strong, undying love of the wife.

=Hil.= And does Reginald know of the change of your heart?

=Adri.= Alas, no! Pride--foolish pride--has kept me from making the
confession to him.

=Hil.= Adrienne, let me beseech you, then, to write to him at once,
and bring the sunshine of joy to his wretched heart. Do not mar your
own happiness by withholding the true state of your feelings. Think
of your child--your darling Alice. Do not deprive her future of the
happiness of a father's love.

=Adri.= I am so unworthy of him. Can he--will he forgive? [_Aside._]
His words when he left me--"Perhaps in time your feelings may change;
if so, the words 'Reginald, I love you--come back,' will bring to your
side one who will forever love you." [_To HILDA._] Yes, yes, Hilda,
you have taught me my duty. I will unburden to him my heart. I _will_
say--"Reginald, I love you--come back." [_MORRIS comes forward. Down
L._]

=Mor.= God bless you, my daughter!

=Adri.= You here?

=Mor.= Forgive me, Adrienne, for being a listener. But I am glad, for
it has convinced me how much I had wronged you in my thoughts. It has
shown me the true and loving heart of a woman--of a true and loyal
wife, who can yet be a pride to the loving heart of a husband, and a
joy in the declining years of his father. I have treated you coldly,
harshly, unjustly. I knew not the cause--the motive of your action. I
looked but upon the result. I now ask, in all humility and deference,
your forgiveness. [_He kneels to her._]

=Adri.= Rise, most noble sir! I have naught to forgive! I, alone, am to
blame. I have merited your censure by my conduct. Heaven grant it may
not be too late to restore to your arms an honored and dutiful son, and
to me a cherished and beloved husband.

=Mor.= [_Embraces her._] Adrienne! [_Kisses her forehead._] God bless
you, my daughter! [_His head droops on her shoulder. ADRIENNE gives her
hand to HILDA, who takes it in both her own. Picture. Whistle scene._]

               =Scene 2=: WOOD PASS IN 1ST GROOVE. NIGHT.

          =Enter= _DOLLERCLUTCH, R. 1 E., enveloped in cloak._

=Dol.= I got safely away without being discovered. The camp was wrapped
in slumber, not a soul stirring but the sentinels. [_Looks around._] If
I'm not mistaken, I must be near the house. Ah! some one approaches!
[_He retires._]

                        =Enter= _HILDA, L. 1 E._

=Hil.= If Reginald could but return, how happy they would be! I left
Adrienne writing to him, pouring out the love which will bring joy to
his desolate heart. [_Sighs._] And there's Henry, her brother! How my
thoughts will always revert to him. So manly in his bearing--high in
the appreciation of true worth. If I only were--but no! I must check
the feeling that has sprung up here. [_Pressing her heart._] I must not
forget that my life is linked to another--

=Dol.= [_Aside._] It's she! I'm sure it is!

=Hil.= [_Alarmed._] What's that!--who's there? [_DOLLERCLUTCH comes
forward. HILDA retreats, alarmed._]

=Dol.= Don't be alarmed, my dear girl. Don't you know your old friend?

=Hil.= [_Comes forward doubtfully._] Can it be possible? Mr.
Dollerclutch?

=Dol.= Yes, my dear girl, your stanch friend, Dollerclutch. [_Takes her
hand._]

=Hil.= I'm so glad to meet you! But what brings you in this
neighborhood? Perhaps you know--Oh, tell me, sir! Have you any news?
Relieve my suspense, sir!

=Dol.= I have news, and good news--I've discovered all; now don't you
faint. I've got the record of your marriage--and I have found your
parents. [_HILDA gets faint and staggers._] Oh, Lord! I told you not to
faint--what shall I do? [_He supports her._]

=Hil.= [_Starting up._] 'Tis over, sir! The sudden joy nearly overcame
me.

=Dol.= Now take a strong grip of your nerves--now do--that's a good
girl. I have not a minute to spare. I must get back to camp before my
absence is discovered or I shall get myself in a tight place.

=Hil.= Pardon me, sir! I will be calm!

=Dol.= That's right! [_Takes papers from pocket._] Now listen! I
haven't the time to tell you how I was successful--that I'll do by
letter--but I've got the proofs, and here they are. That is the record
of your marriage, and this is part of a letter from which, I think, I
have found out that you are the daughter of Morris Maitland.

=Hil.= [_Staggers._] Mr. Maitland my father?

=Dol.= Now be careful, I tell you! Don't forget your nerves. Now listen
to what I say. Take these papers and this dress to Morris Maitland.
[_Hands her papers and baby dress._] Tell him your story and I'll stake
my life on it that he will find a daughter and you a father.

=Hil.= How can I ever repay you for your kindness to me? You have
raised a burden from my life that was crushing me. Heaven bless you,
sir! May you meet the reward that your large and magnanimous heart
deserves.

=Dol.= I haven't got any such heart! you are mistaken--entirely
mistaken. My action was in the line of duty--purely in duty, without
any kindness whatever, do you understand? Now go! lose not a moment and
be careful not to lose the papers. [_Gently forces her to L. 1 E._]

=Hil.= I will, sir! and Heaven bless you. [=Exit= _L. 1 E._]

=Dol.= Now, I've got that poor girl happy, now for my own happiness. If
I could only meet my Anastasia! Now why the deuce didn't I ask that
girl to tell her to come out a few moments? George Washington, you're
an idiot to let a little excitement get away with your head. But who
comes this way? [_DOLLERCLUTCH hides._]

                        =Enter= _RALPH, R. 1 E._

=Ralph.= So! Adrienne must be the magnet which drew him from his post
of duty. I followed him like a ferret, and I'm sure that we are in the
neighborhood of his home. Curse him, he can walk like a race horse! I
had to run, at times, to keep up with him. Go to your Adrienne, you
vain fool, go to the wife whose heart enshrines another. I wish you
joy! But I too shall, perhaps, see an opportunity to speak to the proud
and haughty beauty! If I do, I'll humble her pride--curse her! [=Exit=
_L. 1 E._]

=Dol.= [_Comes forward._] Ralph Murdell, by the jumping jingo! What
brings him to this neighborhood? No good, I'll be bound! If he should
run across Hilda before she gets to the house it might upset all. No!
not while old Dollerclutch can prevent it. I'll follow the rascal, and,
if he as much as attempts to injure a hair of the girl's head, I'll
treat his black carcass to an ounce of lead. Hang me if I don't see
this thing through! [=Exit= _L. 1 E. Whistle scene._]

                      =Scene 3=: SAME AS SCENE 1.

 _ADRIENNE discovered at table, L. C., writing. ALICE in crib, L. 4 E._

=Adri.= [_Sealing letter._] 'Tis done at last! With what feelings of
anxiety shall I count the hours until I have his reply! Will it bring
happiness to my longing heart? Yes, yes! His is a love that time cannot
change, nor separation dim! [_Goes to crib, L. 4 E._] How sweetly she
sleeps! [_She kneels in prayer._] Heaven preserve my darling child!
Watch over her with thy faithful love and guidance. Guard the father
with thy holy protection from the dangers of this cruel war, and
restore him safely to the bosom of his sorrowing family. [_Her head
droops. After a slight pause she gets up hurriedly._] I will take the
letter to John, so that he will be sure to take it to the post-office
the first thing in the morning. [=Exit= _ADRIENNE, D. L. 2 E._]

    _After a pause_ =Enter= _REGINALD, D. R. F.; he looks around
    eagerly; places his gun against chair, R. 2 E._

=Reg.= No one here? How my heart does beat in anticipation of seeing my
beloved Alice. [_Looks around._] Oh, the bitter memories that haunt my
mind at the sight of each familiar object! [_Sees crib, L. 4 E. Goes
to it eagerly and pulls curtain aside._] My child! my Alice! Heavenly
Father, I thank Thee! She sleeps. Oh, Thou being of innocence, free
from the taint of a deceitful world, I will not disturb the peaceful
quiet of thy innocent slumber. Let me feast my eyes upon my sleeping
darling! [_He kneels._] Let the sweet picture of purity and innocence
be forever hung in the desolate cavern of my bleeding heart, safely to
guide me to that eternal home where the soul can find a haven of peace
and rest! [_His head sinks._]

    =Enter= _ADRIENNE, door L. 2 E. She goes to R. C. and sees
    REGINALD. She is alarmed._

=Adri.= What means this? A stranger!

=Reg.= [_Rises suddenly and turns._] Adrienne! [_He turns away._]

=Adri.= Reginald! [_She pauses, with heaving bosom._]

=Reg.= I beg your pardon, Adrienne, for this intrusion. The impulse to
see my child caused me to forsake my post of duty. It led me here to
have but one look upon her darling form. I have been satisfied and I
am ready to return to the stern post of duty. [_He turns to go towards
door in L. F._]

=Adri.= And have you no word for me? [_He pauses._] Not a look for the
mother of your child? [_REGINALD keeps his back towards her. ADRIENNE
stretches her arms towards him._] Am I so soon forgotten? [_He presses
his brow. Pause._] Reginald, I love you! come back! [_Reginald turns
suddenly and springs towards her._]

=Reg.= Adrienne! [_She falls into his arms._] My beloved Adrienne!

=Adri.= [_After a pause._] Now am I happy, indeed! My prayers have been
answered!

=Reg.= Heaven is, indeed, merciful, in bringing this joy into my dreary
existence! I fulfilled my duty as a soldier more with the desire to die
in the service of my country, than to live. But now, I enter the fight
doubly armed, for I now know that I have something more to live for
besides my child--a loving wife.

=Adri.= Heaven grant you will be spared to us, Reginald!

=Reg.= We will put our trust in Him above, who has granted me the boon
of this happy hour! Alas that I must tear myself away from my new found
joy! But duty demands that I return at once to my post.

=Adri.= Nay, Reginald, I cannot let you go again.

=Reg.= Alas! Adrienne, you must bear the separation calmly, for my sake
and for the child's. I left my post without permission, and should my
absence be discovered I shall be court-martialed. A few hours ago I
feared not the consequences of my rash act. But now I dread it, for
your sake. I must return at once, while there is yet time. Let the
thoughts of our child be your strength in my absence, as she will be
mine in the heat of battle. May the Lord of Hosts bring this bloody
war to a speedy close. [_Goes to crib._] Farewell! my child! [_Kisses
her._] Farewell! my beloved wife! [_Kisses her. She clings to him._]
Heaven guard and keep you. [_REGINALD tears himself from ADRIENNE and_
=Exits= _door L. F. hurriedly, leaving his gun behind. ADRIENNE sinks
into chair R. of table._]

=Adri.= Cruel, cruel fate! [_Her head droops._]

                      =Enter= _RALPH, door R. F._

=Adri.= [_Starts up joyfully._] Reginald! [_Sees it is RALPH. She draws
herself haughtily erect._] Ralph Murdell!

=Ralph.= [_Comes down R. Sneeringly._] Even I, Adrienne, your humble
servant!

=Adri.= What means this intrusion, sir, at this hour of the night?

=Ralph.= I never had the pleasure of congratulating you before on your
happy marriage!

=Adri.= Sir, you will oblige me by leaving this house!

=Ralph.= [_Aside._] That cut, did it? [_To ADRIENNE._] Pardon me,
madam, but if you will allow me to offer my sincere sympathy for your
loveless married life----

=Adri.= Leave this house instantly, or I will call assistance to eject
you forcibly!

=Ralph.= Ha! ha! ha! I made sure there was no one about to disturb us
ere I entered.

=Adri.= What do you mean?

=Ralph.= Just this! That there is not a soul within the reach of your
voice. We are alone. But listen to me, Adrienne. I do not wish you
harm--on the contrary, I offer you happiness.

=Adri.= I do not understand you, sir!

=Ralph.= When you married Reginald Maitland, it was not because you
loved him, but to gratify a feeling of pique. You gave him your hand,
but not your heart. That belonged to me! I have watched your husband
every day and have read the unhappiness and misery that he tries to
conceal. Adrienne, you are unhappy in the bonds that tie you to a
loveless life. Therefore, fly with me, and I will show you a life's
loving devotion--a life----

=Adri.= Enough! Do not pollute further the sanctity of a true and
honest husband's roof with the vile utterances of depraved villainy. My
husband I adore, and I will be loyal to him and faithful unto death.
Your influence over my heart is forever broken, and I would sooner
suffer death, aye, a thousand times, than to listen to another word
from you, whom I hate and despise--yea, whom I loathe more than a viper
in my path! Go, and may Heaven have mercy on your soul! [_She turns
away in majestic contempt._]

=Ralph.= [_Sees REGINALD'S gun and takes it._] Curse you! Those words
have sealed your doom! [_He shoots. ADRIENNE staggers and falls._] Ha!
ha! ha! Now, my proud beauty, perhaps your pride is humbled! Ha! ha!
ha! [_Looks around cautiously, puts out light, then gropes for door._]

                   =Enter= _DOLLERCLUTCH, door R. F._

=Dol.= [_Feeling in the dark._] I'm sure he came this way--and that
shot! I'm afraid all is not right. [_Runs into RALPH._] Ha! [_They
struggle. RALPH throws DOLLERCLUTCH from him and escapes through door,
R. F._] Confound it! He's got away! But I've got his ring, which
slipped from his finger into my hand. He shan't escape--I'll have him
yet. [=Exit= _hurriedly, door R. F._]

             _After a pause_ =Enter= _REGINALD, door L. F._

=Reg.= The house is dark. Adrienne has retired for the night. In the
excitement and haste of my departure I forgot my gun. [_He feels around
in the dark._] I stood it here against a chair! [_Finds it._] Ah!
It would not do to return without it. I feel almost tempted to call
Adrienne, that I might once more clasp her to my heart--but, no! I
have delayed too long already. I will live on the fond remembrance of
our happy meeting, and pray that the day be not far distant when I can
feast my heart upon the smiles of my beloved wife and child! [=Exit=
_door R. F._]

ACT V.


                  =Scene 1=: CAMP; SAME AS THIRD ACT.

    _Table, R. 2 E. CORIOLANUS on duty as sentinel, L. 1 E. ADOLPHUS in
    front of tent, C., cleaning gun; COLONEL MORRELL, CAPTAIN LOWVILLE
    and MAJOR MURDELL at table, R. 2 E., in consultation, as curtain
    rises._

=Colonel Morrell.= I agree with you, gentlemen, fully, and I have
concluded not to advance further until I receive more definite news of
the movements of the main body. We will, therefore, continue in camp
till I give you further instructions.

=Hen.= According to all reports, the rebs are badly crippled, and Lee
cannot hold out much longer. At all events, I should not be surprised
to hear of his surrender to Grant in the near future.

=Mor.= Yes, there is all prospect of a speedy ending of this bloody
strife, and I hope we will soon have peace restored, that we may be
enabled to return to our homes and families! [_About to rise._]

=Ralph.= One moment, Colonel! before you go! It is with regret that I
must call your attention to a private in our command who deserted his
post as sentinel!

=Mor.= Indeed! His name!

=Ralph.= Reginald Maitland! [_HENRY rises._]

=Mor.= [_Jumps up._] What! Reginald Maitland? Impossible!

=Ralph.= [_Rises._] I beg your pardon, Colonel, but it is a fact!

=Hen.= Surely, Major, you must be mistaken!

=Mor.= Reginald Maitland--a soldier ever ready to respond to the
call of duty; always fulfilling his orders in the most praiseworthy
manner--he desert his post? [_Shakes his head._] Please explain, Major!

=Ralph.= 'Tis surprising, indeed! but, nevertheless, a fact! I saw him
leave myself--he seemed to be greatly agitated. He was absent three
hours!

=Mor.= Enough! Send for him to report to me at once!

=Ralph.= [_To ADOLPHUS._] Adolphus! [_ADOLPHUS salutes._] Request
Private Maitland to report to Colonel Morrell immediately! [_ADOLPHUS
salutes and goes to tent, R. 5 E._]

=Hen.= [_Aside._] Strange! What can it mean?

=Ralph.= [_Aside._] At last!

    =Enter= _REGINALD from tent; he comes down and salutes. RALPH, R.,
    HENRY, R. C., COL. MORRELL, C., REGINALD, L. C., ADOLPHUS, L._

=Reg.= Colonel Morrell, I'm at your service, sir!

=Mor.= Maitland, were you not detailed as sentinel last night?

=Reg.= I was, sir!

=Mor.= Did you fulfill your duty to the letter? [_REGINALD hangs his
head._] You are silent! Speak!

=Reg.= Colonel Morrell, it is with shame I acknowledge that I have
proved unfaithful to my duty--I deserted my post, sir!

=Mor.= Maitland, it pains me to know that you, on whose honor and
probity I would have staked my existence, should be guilty of this
offense. It is with regret that I am obliged to perform the duty which
devolves upon me!

=Reg.= Colonel, the offense is a grave one. I have merited the
punishment it demands. I am ready to receive it.

=Mor.= What was your motive in forsaking duty?

=Reg.= It was an uncontrollable impulse to see my child, whom I had
never seen before, that swayed my being--I knew not what I did! My
heart was filled with a mad desire to see my child. Duty, honor, all
was forgotten. I could not resist the longing, the yearning of the
father, but I followed the impulse which completely overpowered my
reason.

=Mor.= And do you know that the penalty for your offense, according to
the rules and regulations of war, is death?

=Reg.= I do! and I will not shrink from receiving my punishment. I am
ready, Colonel, to receive sentence.

=Hen.= [_Aside._] As fearless and brave as a lion!

=Mor.= [_Aside._] No! I cannot do it! [_To REGINALD._] Maitland, under
the circumstances, and in consideration of your past praiseworthy
service, and your undaunted gallantry in action, I will not execute the
punishment which the offense merits.

=Hen.= [_Aside._] Bravo, Colonel!

=Ralph.= [_Aside._] Curse his sympathy!

=Mor.= But I cannot let the matter pass unnoticed. I place you under
arrest for three weeks. You will be confined in the guard-house
under close surveillance. Private Softhead, deprive him of his arms
and accoutrements, and conduct him in disgrace to the guard-house.
[_ADOLPHUS takes REGINALD'S gun, etc., and places them on the table._]

=Ralph.= [_Aside._] How it cuts his proud nature!

=Hen.= [_Aside to MORRELL._] These are hard lines, Colonel!

=Mor.= [_Aside to HENRY._] Yes, Captain! I regret it sincerely! I never
before was obliged to do anything that gave me so much pain. But duty,
as a true soldier, demanded it!

=Adol.= [_To REGINALD._] Right face! Forward march. [=Exit= _REGINALD
and ADOLPHUS, R. 4 E._]

=Cor.= [_Looking off L. 2 E._] Halt! Who goes there? [_Voice off
entrance_, "Friend bearing dispatches for the commanding officer."]
Advance, and deliver! [_CORIOLANUS gets them and hands them to COLONEL
MORRELL._] Colonel, allow me! [_He salutes and retires to his post._]

=Mor.= [_Opening dispatches._] What's this? Can I believe my eyes?
[_Reads._] "Adrienne Maitland, the wife of Reginald Maitland, was found
last night, shot in the head. From the evidence I have collected, I am
satisfied that the husband is the murderer. I send you the proofs. H.
Carson, Chief of Police." No! no! I cannot believe that that man is
guilty of such an infamous charge. [_To RALPH._] Major! read that, and
say if that is not the most outrageous lie against such an honorable
soldier as Reginald Maitland! [_Hands him paper._]

=Ralph.= [_Aside._] Ha! ha! ha! Now will I have my revenge.

=Hen.= How now, gentlemen, have you bad news?

=Mor.= There! [_Pointing to paper._] Read for yourself! [_RALPH hands
HENRY paper._]

=Hen.= Merciful father! Adrienne killed! [_Staggers._] My sister shot?
[_With force._] Tell me, Colonel, who is the cowardly wretch that
committed this deed? [_RALPH shrugs his shoulders._]

=Mor.= [_Pointing to paper in HENRY'S hand._] Read!

=Hen.= [_Looks on paper._] No! no! no! What! he guilty of her murder!
No! a thousand times no! I would just as readily believe an angel
guilty of the crime as I would Reginald Maitland! No! I will wager my
life on his innocence!

=Ralph.= [_Sneeringly._] But everybody is not likely to share your
opinion!

=Mor.= [_Taking HENRY by the hand._] Lowville, I agree with you! I
cannot believe so noble a character invested with so foul a heart!
Let us investigate the proofs! [_He unfolds another paper. Reads._]
"I inclose the deposition of William Harding, who swears that he
saw Reginald Maitland prowling about the premises in a cautious and
suspicious manner, and that he saw him enter the house about half past
nine o'clock, which was about the time when the deed was committed."

=Hen.= That evidence proves nothing, Colonel.

=Ralph.= It is very significant though!

=Mor.= One moment, gentlemen! [_Reads._] "I also inclose a piece of
blackened paper, evidently the wadding of the gun--also a bullet
which we found imbedded in the wall." [_He pulls blackened paper from
envelope--he smells it._] The wadding of the gun! [_He smooths it
out._] There is writing upon it! H'm! part of a letter. [_Reads._]
"i-l-d Alice!" i-l-d? child Alice, that's it! "loving fath--" father, I
suppose--"Morris Mai--" the rest is burned away.

=Ralph.= A letter from his father. [_To HENRY._] The evidence is
getting strong, Captain, is it not? [_HENRY is silent._]

=Mor.= [_Takes bullet from envelope._] The fatal bullet! [_Examines
it._] Here are two letters on it, R. M.

=Ralph.= Gentlemen, the evidence is conclusive--he is guilty.

=Mor.= Do not be hasty, Major! I am not yet satisfied of his guilt.
[_Aside._] I fear the worst. [_To ADOLPHUS._] Adolphus! conduct Private
Maitland here at once! [_ADOLPHUS salutes and_ =Exits= _R. 4 E._]

=Ralph.= [_Aside._] He cannot escape now.

=Hen.= [_Aside._] Alas! I fear the result!

=Enter= _REGINALD and ADOLPHUS, R. 4 E._

=Mor.= Maitland, I have evidence here which accuses you of murder!

=Reg.= [_Recoiling._] Murder? I, Colonel? I accused of murder?

=Mor.= Yes, you!

=Reg.= [_Quietly._] Whom am I accused of murdering?

=Mor.= Your wife!

=Reg.= [_Staggers._] My wife?--my wife? my Adrienne murdered?--merciful
father! [_Pause. With forced calmness._] I beg your pardon, Colonel,
but I pray you make me not a victim of such cruel jest! [_MORRELL turns
away._] No! no! Tell me 'tis but a jest--tell me it is not true. Oh,
Colonel, tell me that my Adrienne lives--lives--lives! [_He is silent.
To HENRY._] Henry, end this suspense, this torture. Is Adrienne dead?

=Hen.= [_Taking his hand._] Yes, Reginald, it is true!

=Reg.= Alas!--alas! [_His head droops. Slight pause. With force._]
Who--who is the hellish fiend that robbed me of my Adrienne? Tell me,
that I might tear his cowardly body limb from limb.

=Mor.= Maitland, you alone are accused of the crime. [_To ADOLPHUS._]
Softhead! you will take down in writing the proceedings of this
examination. [_ADOLPHUS at table R., HENRY, R. C., RALPH near table,
COL. MORRELL, C., REGINALD, L. C., CORIOLANUS, R. To REGINALD._] Are
you guilty or are you not guilty of the murder of your wife, Adrienne
Maitland?

=Reg.= I murder Adrienne--my wife? ha! ha! ha!--no! She, in whose
happiness my whole soul was wrapped up? No--no!

=Mor.= Answer, guilty or not guilty!

=Reg.= Not guilty!

=Mor.= [_To RALPH._] At what hour did he desert his post?

=Ralph.= Eight o'clock!

=Mor.= [_To REGINALD._] At what hour were you in company with your
wife?

=Reg.= About nine o'clock!

=Mor.= Did you have your gun with you?

=Reg.= I did!

=Mor.= When did you load it last, and where?

=Reg.= Yesterday morning, in my tent!

=Mor.= Did you discharge it since?

=Reg.= No, sir!

=Mor.= Is it still loaded?

=Reg.= It is, sir!

=Mor.= Major Murdell, hand me Maitland's gun. [_He examines it._]
Gentlemen, the gun has been discharged! [_He hands gun back--he then
hands REGINALD blackened paper._] Do you recognize that paper?

=Reg.= [_Looks at paper._] I do! It is part of a letter from my father!
I used it for wadding.

=Mor.= Do you recognize this bullet? [_Hands it._]

=Reg.= [_Examines._] It is from my mould.

=Mor.= Did you have any ill feeling against your wife?

=Reg.= None!

=Ralph.= Colonel, I can prove that there has existed bad feeling
between them since their marriage!

=Mor.= Make your statement!

=Ralph.= They lived unhappily together until an open rupture caused him
to leave her and enlist in the army.

=Mor.= Your proof! [_RALPH points to HENRY._] Lowville, do you
corroborate Major Murdell's assertion? [_HENRY looks at REGINALD. HENRY
is silent._]

=Reg.= Speak, Henry!

=Hen.= [_Aside._] Must I speak? [_After a pause, to MORRELL._] I do!

=Mor.= [_To REGINALD._] What was the nature of the rupture?

=Reg.= I decline to answer.

=Ralph.= That was his motive for the crime!

=Mor.= Silence! [_To REGINALD._] In the face of the evidence, I am
forced to believe you guilty. I regret that a soldier such as you have
heretofore proved yourself to be, should come to such an ignominious
end. [_RALPH consulting with others. HENRY walks aside._]

=Reg.= Do you believe me guilty, Colonel? [_He turns from REGINALD._]
And do you all think me guilty of this cowardly crime? [_They all look
away but HENRY, who takes REGINALD by the hand._]

=Hen.= No! I would believe you innocent, had they ten times the
evidence.

=Ralph.= The evidence has proven his guilt most conclusively!

=Mor.= [_To REGINALD._] Have you anything to say why I should not pass
sentence upon you?

=Reg.= I have not!

=Hen.= Oh, Reginald, why do you not defend yourself? Why not make an
effort to prove your innocence?

=Reg.= Henry, what have I to live for now? Adrienne is gone from me.
She has left the world dark and dreary to me. I long to join her there!
[_Points upward._]

=Hen.= Prove your innocence. Let not the stain of murder rest on your
honorable name!

=Reg.= Henry, this is but the judgment of men. I bow to the judgment
of Him alone who knoweth all things. He knows I am innocent--that is
sufficient. I am satisfied! His will be done! [_To MORRELL._] Colonel,
I await your orders!

=Mor.= [_Aside._] I would I could believe him innocent. The evidence
condemns him! [_Sighs._] I must fulfill my duty! [_To REGINALD._]
Maitland, the evidence that has been brought to bear shows conclusively
that you are guilty! Nothing remains but for me to pass sentence. I
therefore condemn you to be shot until you are dead. [_REGINALD bows
his head._] The sentence shall be executed immediately. I will allow
you five minutes to prepare yourself to meet your God! [_Takes out
watch. To RALPH._] Major! you will detail your men to execute the
order. [_RALPH whispers to CORIOLANUS and ADOLPHUS._]

=Hen.= [_To REGINALD._] Reginald, this is terrible! The Colonel has no
right to use such haste. The evidence is purely circumstantial, and
should require deeper investigation!

=Reg.= Nay, do not blame Colonel Morrell; he has simply done his duty.
Besides, why should the execution be deferred? Why should I longer drag
out a miserable existence? I will soon be happy, Henry, for I shall
meet Adrienne. But my child, Henry! my darling little Alice! Take her,
Henry--be a father to her--guide her footsteps in the path of honor
and virtue. Teach her not to despise her father--that he is innocent.
Teach her not to listen to the sneers of the world, but to place an
everlasting faith in the Father of us all, so that at the last she will
find peace and joy in the beautiful realms above!

=Hen.= I accept the trust, Reginald. God grant I will be faithful to
it. [_They shake hands._] Have you any further wishes?

=Reg.= Tell my father I am innocent--that will be sufficient--he will
believe me. Now leave me, Henry!

=Hen.= Farewell, my brother! [_They embrace._] Farewell! [_REGINALD
kneels a moment with bowed head in silent prayer, after which he rises
with a quiet air._]

=Reg.= I am ready, Colonel! [_MORRELL waves his hand. ADOLPHUS
blindfolds REGINALD, ties his hands behind him, and places him in
position, L. C. ADOLPHUS and CORIOLANUS take position on right._]

=Ralph.= [_COLONEL MORRELL, R., HENRY, R. C., RALPH, R. C., CORIOLANUS
and ADOLPHUS up R., REGINALD, L. C. Pulls handkerchief from pocket._]
Carry arms! Ready! [_Holds handkerchief at arms length._]

              =Enter= _DOLLERCLUTCH, R. 4 E., hurriedly._

=Dol.= [_C._] Hold! If you shoot that man you commit murder! He is
innocent!

=Mor.= [_R. C._] What mean you?

=Ralph.= Will you allow this interference, Colonel?

=Mor.= Yes! God forbid that I should shoot an innocent man! [_To
DOLLERCLUTCH._] Your proofs!

=Dol.= My proofs are crushing! There is no murder! [_REGINALD pulls off
handkerchief._] His wife lives. She is even now on her way to this camp!

=Reg.= Adrienne lives? Thanks be to God!

=Mor.= How do you know this?

=Dol.= I overtook her on the road on my way to camp. She was almost
exhausted, and begged of me to run on and save Reginald from being shot
for her murder. I did so, and here I am, just in the nick of time! By
jingo, I feel so good, I could shake hands with the greatest scoundrel
that ever breathed. [_He shakes RALPH'S hand._]

=Ralph.= Colonel, you surely will not be imposed upon by that rascal's
concocted story?

=Mor.= Silence! If she is not dead, it was not the fault of the
intended murderer. He meant to kill her, and the intent is sufficient
for which to carry out the penalty!

=Dol.= [_R. C._] Correct, Colonel! But that man is not the one who
attempted the murder. I swear that Reginald Maitland left the house
fifteen minutes before the shot was fired. I was watching one whom I
know to be the murderer, prowling around the house; but looking after
Maitland's departure, I lost sight of the other chap. Some time after
I heard the shot and rushed into the house and into the arms of the
attempted assassin, who was trying to escape. I struggled to overpower
him, but he was too much for me. [_Rubs his side and grimaces._] He got
away. I pursued, but he got off in the darkness. In my eagerness to
catch him, I fell into the hands of the rebels.

=Mor.= And how did you get away from the rebels?

=Dol.= This morning, by indomitable bravery and courage, I fought my
way out of their lines and hastened back here to camp.

=Mor.= Who is the man that attempted the deed?

=Dol.= The room was dark; the scoundrel had put out the light; I could
not recognize him!

=Ralph.= [_Aside._] Safe! safe!

=Mor.= How do you know, then, that it was not Maitland?

=Dol.= In the struggle, the villain's ring slipped into my hand. Here
it is, Colonel! [_MORRELL takes and examines it._] Later I also found
this shoulder strap hanging to one of my buttons. [_MORRELL hands ring
to RALPH._] Colonel, do privates wear these things?

=Ralph.= Colonel, here are some letters engraved on the seal--R. M.
Reginald Maitland!

=Dol.= You lie! R. M.--Ralph Murdell, and here is where this belongs,
you cowardly assassin! [_He claps the shoulder strap on RALPH'S
shoulder, which is minus one._]

=Mor.= Men, secure him! [_ADOLPHUS and CORIOLANUS do so. HENRY,
R., CORIOLANUS, RALPH and ADOLPHUS, R. C., COLONEL MORRELL, C.,
DOLLERCLUTCH and REGINALD, L. C._]

=Ralph.= [_To DOLLERCLUTCH._] Curse you for a meddlesome hound!

=Dol.= I said I would, and so I did, by jingo!

    =Enter= _ADRIENNE, R. 4 E., out of breath; her head is bandaged;
    she is very pale and exhausted. REGINALD takes C._

=Adri.= Reginald, my husband!

=Reg.= Adrienne! [_She falls in his arms half fainting._]

=Adri.= Safe! safe! You are safe!

=Reg.= Yes, yes, my wife. Heaven is just! You have been spared to me by
His great mercy.

=Mor.= [_Approaching them._] Pardon me, Maitland, for interrupting.
Allow me to ask you one question, Madam? [_She nods._] Who was it that
fired the shot?

=Adri.= [_Pointing to RALPH._] There stands the coward who, failing
in his effort to make me unfaithful to my true and loyal husband,
attempted to murder me!

=Mor.= [_To REGINALD, taking his hand._] Forgive me, Maitland, for
entertaining one moment the thought that you were guilty of such
cowardly villainy! I have wronged you deeply.

=Reg.= I have naught to forgive, Colonel; you have acted only as a true
soldier, and, had you not done as you did, you would have neglected
your duty.

                        =Enter= _HILDA, R. 4 E._

=Hil.= [_L. C., to ADRIENNE._] You are safe, Adrienne. You rushed from
the house in your frantic excitement. I feared your mind was wandering.

=Adri.= Nay, Hilda! When I learned that my husband was accused of my
supposed murder, I dreaded the consequences, and determined to save him
ere it was too late.

=Hil.= They knew not where you had fled. But I knew where your heart
would lead you, and I followed.

=Hen.= [_Aside._] What a wealth of true womanly feeling is hidden by
her quiet demeanor! [_To HILDA._] Will you be kind enough to enlighten
us, how it was that we received news from the Chief of Police that
Adrienne was murdered?

=Hil.= When we found her last night, we supposed her to be dead,
until this morning I thought I detected signs of life. I begged of
them to summon a physician at once. He pronounced her alive, but in a
death-like stupor. After hard work she was restored to consciousness.
Examination of her wound showed that the bullet had only grazed the
head, inflicting a scalp wound, but sufficient to effectually stun her.

=Hen.= Kind Providence turned the bullet's fatal course, but it was
almost the means of bringing a noble life to an ignominious end.
[_Pointing to REGINALD._]

=Hil.= Have you discovered the real culprit?

=Hen.= Yes! he is there! [_Points to RALPH._]

=Hil.= [_Staggers._] Ralph!--my husband?

=Hen.= Your husband? Is that man your husband?

=Hil.= Alas! yes! With what feelings of loathing must I make the
acknowledgment.

=Ralph.= Bah! you she-devil! I never married you--you were only a
mistress!

=Dol.= You lie, you black-hearted villain!

=Hil.= [_Producing papers._] You could ruin my character in the eyes of
the world did I not possess this! [_Holding paper aloft._] The record
of my marriage to you. [_RALPH recoils._]

=Dol.= [_To RALPH._] And I was the individual who saved that girl from
your base villainy! I--do you understand?--I!

=Ralph.= Curse you!

=Hen.= [_Aside._] Alas for my hopes!

                =Enter= _MORRIS and ANASTASIA, R. 4 E._

=Anas.= [_Going to ADRIENNE and embracing her._] You dear child! How
glad I am that we've found you at last!

=Mor.= Heaven be praised, my daughter, I find you safe. [_He embraces
REGINALD._] My son!

=Reg.= Father!

=Mor.= I am overjoyed at this happy union of loving hearts. [_To
HILDA._] Alice, my child! [_Beckons her to come. To REGINALD._]
Reginald, God has been merciful to restore to us your lost sister--my
darling daughter, Alice!

=Reg.= My sister?

=All.= Your daughter?

=Mor.= Yes! my daughter! [_Embraces her._] After many years of
suffering and anguish has Heaven sent me the joy that I thought was
buried in the past. [_Takes =Dollerclutch= by the hand._] Here is
the instrument of Providence who saved an innocent girl and brought
happiness to a father's heart. [_HILDA converses with HENRY._] Bless
your kind heart! How can I ever repay you?

=Dol.= Tut! tut! tut! I acted only on business--only on business,
sir!--do you understand? Entirely on business--without any kindness
whatever. I am more than repaid when I see the happiness and joy that
surrounds me! [_He goes to ANASTASIA. Up L. C._]

=Mor.= That man's father [_pointing to RALPH_] was the wretch who
stole the child from our parental bosom! His father and I aspired for
the hand of the same lady--I was the successful one. He, being of a
very passionate and revengeful nature, darkened our domestic bliss by
stealing from the cradle our youngest child, Alice! I did not think I
had an enemy in the world who could be guilty of such baseness, until
last night I received the proof which exposed him and restored to me a
daughter. All doubts of her identity were removed by the discovery of a
mole behind her left ear, which we remembered our child's having.

=Morrell.= I congratulate you, sir, upon your new found joy! The mills
of justice grind slowly sometimes, but they are sure. Righteousness
and truth will always receive its blessed reward. [_To CORIOLANUS and
ADOLPHUS._] Men, remove the depraved scoundrel to the guard house
and see that he is strongly guarded. [_They do so._ =Exit= _RALPH,
CORIOLANUS and ADOLPHUS, R. 2 E._] It is a pity to mar the happiness of
this hour with the presence of such a vile and cowardly rascal! [_To
REGINALD._] Maitland, in consideration of the terrible mistake and
injustice by which I almost sacrificed your life, I hereby revoke the
order for your disgrace and restore you to honorable recognition by
promoting you to the position of Major!

=Hen.= Bravo, Colonel!

=Dol.= Good! your heart is in the right place, Colonel! [_Aside._] And
so is mine! [_Turning to ANASTASIA._]

=Reg.= [_Taking MORRELL by the hand._] Thanks, Colonel, thanks!

=Morrell.= Do not thank me, Maitland; you are more than deserving. Had
you accepted promotion before when it was offered, for your gallant
conduct and bravery on the field, you would long since have been even
my superior officer. [_A shot is heard._] What's that? [_All are
alarmed and look off entrance._]

               =Enter= _ADOLPHUS and CORIOLANUS, R. 2 E._

=Adol.= [_R._] He's done it, Colonel!--he's done it!

=Morrell.= Done what? Who?

=Adol.= Ralph Murdell! He pulled a revolver and shot himself through
the head.

=Cor.= Yes! His rash act has precipitated him into eternity--he's dead!

=Morrell.= [_Shrugs his shoulders._] Well, he has only saved me the
stern duty of condemning him to such a fate.

=Hen.= [_Aside._] His act has freed Hilda from the yoke of misery and
despair. [_Commotion outside. Voices heard crying_ "Hurrah!" _in the
distance._]

=Morrell.= What means this excitement? Dollerclutch, go and learn the
cause! [=Exit= _DOLLERCLUTCH, L. 2 E., hastily._] They are yelling
hurrah! There must be some good news from the front. They seem wild
with joy!

                   =Re-enter= _DOLLERCLUTCH, L. 2 E._

=Dol.= [_Rushing around excitedly._] Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!

=Morrell.= [_Stopping him._] Give us the news.

=Dol.= Hurrah! The war is over! Lee has surrendered to Grant!

=Omnes.= Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! [_Wild excitement and joy._]

=Reg.= [_Embracing ADRIENNE._] Then is our happiness complete. We shall
never part again.

=Dol.= And I will, at last, leave my bachelorhood and worship at the
shrine of my charming Anastasia!

=Anas.= [_Falls in his arms._] You dear man!

=Cor.= [_Aside._] She throws true nobility aside [_pointing to
himself_] for such a presumptuous old fool! Oh! woman! woman! [_Sighs
deeply and walks aside._]

=Hen.= [_Leading HILDA forward. To MORRIS._] If you will allow me, let
me add my joy to the already o'erflowing cup! Hilda has--[_HILDA pulls
his coat._] I beg your pardon--Alice has promised to administer to my
future joy, with your permission!

=Morris.= [_Joins their hands._] Bless you, my children!

=Adri.= [_To REGINALD._] Dearest Reginald! The joy I have found in the
new born love for my noble husband will make me never regret that it
was by force of impulse that I was led to accept your heart and hand!

=Reg.= Let the agony of the past be buried in the joy of the present.
[_To audience._] And if you will forgive the impulse that led me from
my post of duty, there will not be a cloud to obscure the sunshine of
our future happiness.

=Morrell.= The end has justified the act.

=Dol.= I, too, have left my post of duty--but let the result be an
extenuation of my desertion.

=Morrell.= [_Takes him by hand._] Yes! I overlook it freely! and I feel
satisfied that He, who watches over us all, will not censure us for
being led BY FORCE OF IMPULSE!

THE TRIPLE WEDDING.

A DRAMA, IN THREE ACTS, BY CHARLES BARNARD.

Four male, four female characters--Leading juvenile man, comic old man,
first and second comedians; leading juvenile lady, two walking ladies
and servant. Plain room scene; modern costumes.

The plot is novel and ingenious, the situations well worked out, and
the interest continuous.

Wedding. Time of performance, one hour and a quarter.


SECOND SIGHT; OR, YOUR FORTUNE FOR A DOLLAR.

Four male and one female characters--Light comedian, low comedian,
Irishman, Mexican nobleman and juvenile lady. Scene: A Clairvoyant's
Parlor in New York. Time of playing, one hour.

The frantic efforts of Mr. Birdwhistle, a timorous music teacher, to
escape the fury of Don Fiasco de Caramba, an untamed Mexican; the
dismal predicaments of Dionysius O. Rourké and the clairvoyant scenes
will keep the audience in a continuous ripple. Companies in search of a
serious piece should NOT select this play.


WANTED: A CONFIDENTIAL CLERK.

A FARCE, IN ONE ACT, BY W. F. CHAPMAN.

Six male characters, _viz._: Eccentric old man, with a partiality for
proverbs; Irishman, "dude," shabby genteel comedian, talkative "sport,"
and clerk. No scenery required. Time of playing, thirty minutes.

A capital farce, containing none but "star" parts, with scope for
easy character acting, racy dialogue, funny situations and comical
"business."


A LESSON IN ELEGANCE.

A COMEDY IN ONE ACT, BY BERNARD HERBERT.

Four female characters--A butterfly of fashion, comic servant, old
lady and unsophisticated young widow. The scene (interior) is laid at
Newport in the height of the season.

Consists purely of light comedy, is bright and brisk in action, with
plenty of "business," and has a _dénouement_ as unexpected as it is
welcome. The play can be effectively staged and costumed, if desired.
Time of representation, thirty minutes.


BY FORCE OF IMPULSE.

second juvenile ladies and comic old maid.

A thoroughly good drama, worthy of the best talent. The action takes
place during the period of the late civil war, the scene being laid
partly in the army. Well adapted to the use of G. A. R. posts, though
not confined to them in interest. The plot is interesting and well
developed; the situations are striking; the "business" is effective,
and every tableau will fetch an _encore._ Time of representation, two
hours and a half.

    the confidence which experience can bring. The writer is especially
    explicit in showing how the effects of scenery and costume may
    be secured with the simplest of material, so that the degree of
    expense may be made a matter of choice."--_Buffalo Express._

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
