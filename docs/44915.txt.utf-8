PREFACE.


This book contains a variety of receipts, from the finest French dishes
to the most ordinary cooking. They are reliable, as nearly every one
has been used by me at different times. My experience in the work has
prompted me to issue this book, every part of which has been dictated
by me, and carefully written down by my friend, Louise A. Smith.

No. 1.

OX TAIL SOUP.

Soak 3 tails in warm water. Put into a gallon stewpan 8 cloves, 2
onions, 1 teaspoonful each of allspice and black pepper, and the tails
cover with cold water. Skim often and carefully. Let simmer gently
until the meat is tender and leaves the bones easily. This will take 2
hours. When done take out the meat and cut it off the bones. Skim the
broth and strain it through a sieve. To thicken it put in flour and
butter, or 2 tablespoonfuls of the fat you have taken off the broth
into a clean stewpan, with as much flour as will make a paste. Stir
well over the fire; then pour in the broth slowly while stirring. Let
it simmer for one-half hour; skim, and strain through a sieve. Put in
the meat with a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, a glass of wine;
season with salt.


No. 2.

MOCK TURTLE.

Get a calf's head with skin on, take out the brains, wash the head
several times in cold water, let it soak one hour in spring water,
then lay in a stewpan, and cover with cold water, and half a gallon
over. Take off the scum that rises as it warms. Let it boil for one
hour, take it up and, when almost cold, cut the head into pieces one
and a half inches, and the tongue into mouthfuls, or make a side dish
of tongue and brains. When the head is taken out put in the stock
meat, about 3 pounds of knuckle of veal, and as much beef, add all the
trimmings and bones of the head, skim it well, cover close, let it boil
5 hours (save 2 quarts of this for gravy sauce), strain it off and let
stand until morning; then take off the fat; set a large stewpan on the
fire, with half a pound of fresh butter, 12 ounces of sliced onions,
4 ounces of green sage; chop it a little; let these fry 1 hour, then
rub in one pound of flour, then add the broth by degrees until it is
as thick as cream. Season with 1/4 ounce of ground allspice, 1/2 ounce
of black pepper ground fine, salt to your taste the rind of a lemon
peeled thin. Let it simmer gently for 1-1/2 hours, strain through a
hair sieve. If it does not go through easily press a wooden spoon
against the sides of the sieve. Put it in a clean stewpan with the
head, and season it by putting to each gallon of soup 1/2 pint of wine,
2 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Let it simmer until the meat is tender
(from 1/2 hour to 1 hour). Take care it is not overdone. Stir often to
keep the meat from sticking to the pan. When the meat is quite tender
the soup is ready. A head of 20 pounds and 10 pounds of stock-meat will
make 10 quarts of soup, besides the 2 quarts of stock-meat set aside
for side dishes. If there is more meat on the head than you wish to use
make a ragout pie of some of it.


No. 3.

MOCK MOCK TURTLE.

Line the bottom of a 5-pint stewpan with 1 ounce of lean bacon or ham,
1-1/2 pounds lean gravy beef, a cow's heel, inner rind of a carrot, a
sprig of lemon thyme, winter savory, 3 sprigs of parsley, a few green
leaves of sweet basil, 2 onions, a large onion with 4 cloves stuck in
it, 18 grains of allspice, 18 grains of pepper. Pour on these 1 pint
of cold water, cover the stewpan and set it on a slow fire to boil
gently 1/4 hour. Watch it carefully, if need be, with the cover off,
until it gets a good brown color; then fill up the stewpan with boiling
water, and let it simmer for 2 hours. If you wish you can cut up some
of the meat into mouthfuls and put into the soup. To thicken it take
2 tablespoonfuls of flour, a ladleful of gravy, mix them and pour it
into the stewpan where the gravy is, let it simmer 1/2 hour longer.
Skim it and strain through a fine sieve. Cut the cow's heel in pieces 1
inch square. Squeeze the juice of a lemon, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom
catsup, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1/2 teaspoonful of black pepper, a pinch
of grated nutmeg, a glass of Madeira or sherry wine, through a sieve
into the stewpan of soup; let simmer 5 minutes longer.


No. 4.

SOUTHERN MOCK TURTLE SOUP.

Wash a calf's head clean, put 2 gallons of water on it, set it to boil;
put in a hock of ham (smoked), weighing about 2 pounds, also thyme,
3 onions, 1 bunch of celery tops, 1 tablespoonful each of allspice
cloves, not ground; let it boil down slowly to 1-1/2 gallons. When
the head is done take it out, being careful to remove the brains and
tongue, then cut the meat into small pieces. Strain the soup; brown 1/2
pound of flour and make a batter of it to thicken the soup; grate 1/2
of a nutmeg in it, put in pepper and salt to taste; take a portion of
the brain and make it into small cakes, as you would fritters, fry them
in lard; take 1/2 pound of veal cutlets, and a small part of the ham,
chop up with a little parsley and onion, season with pepper and salt;
make small forcemeat balls, frying them in lard, having first rolled
them in eggs, then in breadcrumbs; put the forcemeat ball in the soup
just before dishing up, together with 1/2 pint of wine.


No. 5.

CELERY SOUP.

After splitting 6 heads of celery into pieces about 2 inches long, wash
them well, lay them on a hair sieve to drain, and put them in 3 quarts
of clear gravy soup in a gallon soup-pot; let it stew just enough to
make the celery tender, say about 1 hour; take off the scum if any
should rise, season with a little salt. Should you wish to make this
soup at a season when you could not get celery, use the celery seed,
say about 1/2 pint, put this in the soup 1/4 hour before it is done,
with a little sugar.


No. 6.

PEASE SOUP AND PICKLED PORK.

Take 2 pounds of the flank of pickled pork. Care must be taken that the
pork is not too salty, otherwise lay it in water the night before. Put
1 quart pease (split), 2 heads of cut celery, 2 onions peeled, 1 sprig
of sweet marjoram in 3 quarts of water; boil gently for 2 hours, then
put in the pork. Let this boil until it is done enough to eat. When
done wash it clean in hot water and place it on a dish, or else cut it
in mouthfuls and put in a tureen with the soup.


No. 7.

PLAIN PEASE SOUP.

One quart of split peas, 2 heads of celery; let them simmer gently in
broth or soft water (3 quarts) over a slow fire, stirring every now and
then to keep the pease from burning. Add more water should it boil away
or the soup get too thick. After boiling for 3 hours put them through
a coarse sieve, then through a fine one. Wash out your stewpan and
put the soup back into it, let it boil up once. Take off the scum if
any. Fry small square pieces of bread in hot lard until they become a
delicate brown; take them out and let them drain on a sheet of paper.
Send these up with the soup in one side dish and dry powdered mint or
sweet marjoram in another.


No. 8.

LOBSTER SOUP.

Take 3 fine, lively hen lobsters, boil them; when cold split the tails;
take out the fish, crack the claws, and cut the meat in mouthfuls; take
out the coral and soft part of the body, crush part of the coral in
a mortar; pick out the fish from the shell, beat part of it with the
coral; out of this make forcemeat balls, flavored with mace, nutmeg,
grated lemon peel, cayenne, and anchovy. Pound these, with the yolk of
an egg. Have ready 3 quarts of veal broth, bruise the small legs and
the shell, and put them into it to boil for 20 minutes, then strain. To
thicken the soup take the live spawn, crush it in the mortar, with a
little butter and flour, rub it through a sieve and add it to the soup
with the meat of the lobsters and the rest of the coral; let it simmer
gently for 10 minutes.


No. 9.

ASPARAGUS SOUP.

Take all the tender portion of three good-sized bunches of asparagus.
This will make 2 quarts of soup. Put a large saucepan half full of
water on the fire; when it boils put one-half of the asparagus in, with
a little salt; let it boil till done, then drain it off. Put in a clean
stewpan, with 3 quarts of plain veal or mutton broth, cover up close,
and stew one hour over a slow fire. Rub through a sieve, then cut the
other half of the asparagus in pieces one inch long, and send up in the
soup.


No. 10.

TOMATO SOUP OR MOCK HOCK SOUP.

One quart of tomatoes, put on fire and let boil; when done mash through
a sieve 3 tablespoonfuls of sugar, 1 teaspoonful nutmeg and mace
together, and put in tomatoes, 1 tablespoonful of butter, mixed with a
large tablespoonful of flour, stir all into the tomatoes, and put on
to boil again; stir till it boils. Quarter of an hour before serving
pour in 1 pint of milk. Pepper and salt to taste. Stir till it boils up
nicely. Put in 2 tablespoonfuls wine just before dishing up.


No. 11.

FRIED OYSTERS.

For this purpose each and every oyster should be as large, plump,
and fat--fresh, of course, not salt--as you can procure. Any small
ones will serve for sauces, croquettes, soups, etc. Drain off their
juice, put them in a bowl, cover them with ice water, let stand
a few minutes, then place them in a colander and drain them. Dry
between two thin, soft towels, without pressing them, and lay upon a
moulding-board, slightly coated with cracker-dust, finely sifted. Beat
up to a thick rich custard as many eggs and an equal measure of cream
as you need for moistening all the oysters, adding, at the last, a
saltspoonful of salt for every three eggs. Have ready a sufficiency of
finely-sifted bread crumbs prepared by rubbing the heart of a stale
loaf of white bread in a towel and pressing it through a sieve. Dip
the oysters, one by one, into the beaten egg and roll them in the
crumbs till covered in every part. By no means flatten them, but keep
them as round and plump as possible; lay them on napkins and keep in
a cool place for half an hour; again dip, roll in crumbs, and set
aside for another half hour. Now lay them on the wire stand, not quite
touching each other. Set the stand into a deep frying-pan nearly full
of whatever frying mixture you use, which must be boiling hot, and fry
quickly to a deep yellow color, but do not brown them, or they will be
tough and greasy. Lift the stand out of the pan, drain quickly, and
serve the oysters on a hot, white napkin, placed on a hot platter,
and garnish with sprigs of parsley or water cress, stuffed olives,
and small bits of lemon. The daintiest condiment of all is the French
mayonnaise sauce served with lettuce.


No. 12.

cochineal, cream, butter and sugar; add the milk, flavoring, whites
and flour. Divide the latter into three parts. Bruise and pound a few
leaves of spinach in thin muslin bags until you can express the juice.
Put a few drops of this into one portion of the batter; color another
with cochineal, leaving the third white. Put a little of each into
small round pans or cups, giving a little stir to each color as you
add the next. This will vein the cakes prettily. Put the white between
the pink and green that the tints may show better. If you can get
pistachionuts to pound up for the green the cakes will be much nicer.

HOW TO MAKE GOOD BREAD.

Sift your flour into your mixing-pan, warming it a little in cold
weather, and make a hole in the center, and into this hole pour your
sponge and stir the whole to the consistency of cake, and then let it
stand in a warm place until it rises and becomes very light; then knead
it thoroughly from all sides, adding flour as needed, and when it will
not stick to your fingers or the side of the pan, set it aside until it
rises again; then make it into five or six loaves, put them into your
baking pans, and set them away in a warm place until it raises nicely,
and then put it into the oven and bake it. A little experimenting will
soon make you an efficient baker.

FISH, BOILED.

Place the fish in salted water, cold, if the fish is large, and hot if
small sized. In the latter case, 2 or 3 minutes in boiling water will
be enough; and a sheep's-head of 4 or 5 pounds will not require more
than 10 minutes from the time the water boils. Use a strainer to place
fish in saucepan. Salmon and all dark-fleshed fish require more boiling

KIDNEYS.

Cut them lengthwise, score them, sprinkle some pepper and salt on them,
and run a wire skewer through them to keep them from curling on the
gridiron, that they may broil evenly. Broil them over a clear fire,
turning them often till done. This will take about 10 or 12 minutes if
you have a brisk fire, or fry them in butter, and make a gravy in the
pan after taking the kidneys out by putting in a teaspoonful of flour;
as soon as it looks brown, put in as much water as will make gravy. It
will take 5 minutes more to fry them than to broil them. A few parsley
leaves chopped fine, and mixed with a little butter, pepper, and salt,
may be put on each kidney.

STEAKS.

Cut the steaks rather thinner than for broiling. Put some butter into a

relishing.

TONGUE.

Tongue requires more cooking than a ham. One that has been salted and
dried should be put to soak 24 hours before wanted, in plenty of water;
a green one from the pickle needs soaking only a few hours. Put the

and give it from 3-1/2 to 4 hours very slow simmering according to size.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
