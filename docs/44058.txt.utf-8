PREFACE.

----

In closing our second series of ZOOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATIONS, we cannot but
express gratification at the terms in which they have been alluded to at
home and abroad. It is hardly necessary to state that the scientific
interest of the subjects described, and the attention bestowed upon the
plates, have progressively increased, as the work has approached its
termination. The contents of this series may now be divided into three
equal portions, so that the BIRDS, the INSECTS, and the SHELLS, will form
distinct and uniform volumes, unconnected, except in the general title,
with each other.

As complete sets of the first series have now become very scarce, new
editions of the deficient parts are in rapid progress; and the whole will
then be divided, as above, into three portions.

It is but justice to Mr. G. Bayfield,[1] that the author should here
express his satisfaction at the skill and care with which he has executed
the colouring of the plates, both of this work, and of every other in which
his services have been engaged.

In answer to several correspondents who have requested to know what book we
can recommend, as giving a general and popular introduction to the
_natural_ arrangement of animals, we are obliged to confess that amid
countless volumes of anecdotes, compilations, and methods, no such work has
ever been undertaken. With the intention of supplying this deficiency, we
have devoted the greatest portion of the last five years to an Encyclopedia
of Zoology; wherein the science will be placed under a new and striking
light; no less instructive to the general reader, than interesting to the
learned. In another year, we trust this work will be before the public. To
_that_ volume we must consequently refer the readers of _this_, whenever
they wish to understand the full scope and influence of those novelties in
natural arrangment, which are but slightly glanced at in the following
descriptions.

As more than usual care is necessary in the binding of these volumes, it
may be as well to mention that we have particularly instructed Mr. Betts,
of Compton Street, Brunswick Square, on this subject.

Large flocks of these resplendent Lorys enliven the woods of New Holland,
clinging to the Eucalypti trees, and sucking the honey from the blossoms by
their brush-shaped tongue. Mr. Caley, whose notes we now follow, says it a
bird remarkable for docility and attachment to some people, although a
perfect scold to others. When young they are caught by the natives, but
from the loss of their favourite food seldom survive in confinement. An
individual, kept by Mr. Caley, on being shewn the coloured drawing of a
native plant, tried to suck the flowers, and it even made the same attempt
with a piece of cotton furniture. Its scientific history we have already
given elsewhere.

We have received more than usual pleasure at seeing our name affixed to
this charming bird, and in clearing up its history. (_Ill. of Orn. vol. 3.
p. iii._) As a child we well remember our unwearied delight at seeing its
figure in _White's Voyage_. As a collector we have preserved a series of
nearly twenty specimens, and as a naturalist our name is no longer excluded
from the Ornithological Nomenclature of New Holland. It is indeed somewhat
curious, that while we were giving information to one of the writers in the
_Lin. Trans_. upon the subjects of his paper, he should have studiously
witheld from us the only public acknowledgement, for such assistance, it
was in his power to make.

From the resemblance which this insect bears to the rare British species,
named by collectors the scarce Swallow-tail, (_Papilio Podalirius_,) it is
generally called the Brazilian Swallow-tail. We advert to this
circumstance, trivial as it may sound to scientific ears, first because it
is one of the many proofs in which the nomenclature of the vulgar conveys
greater information than that of the professor: and secondly, because these
very names, in numberless instances, imply a perception of natural
analogies, which, without the labour of philosophic research, suggest
themselves to unscientific observers. In the present instance, these facts
may be verified in the most unquestionable manner. According to our views,
_Protesilaus_ not only represents one of the primary groups of the
Lepidoptera, but also typifies the Fissirostral birds, of which the
swallows are the most pre-eminent.

Madam Merian's valuable work on the Insects of Surinam, has furnished us
with a figure of the larva; which, unlike that of the European
Swallow-tails, is covered with spines: the chrysalis also departs from the
usual type of the family, in having the head directed downwards. These
facts we have verified by an inspection of the original drawings, of M.
Merian, now deposited in the British Museum. These are all important
variations in structure, which can only be explained by the natural system.

For a long time, the only museum in Europe which could boast of this
butterfly, was that of Sir Joseph Banks; who found it in Van Deimans Land,
during his celebrated scientific voyage with Captain Cook. Fabricius, the
most eminent entomologist of that day, described the species from this
specimen: which, with the whole of the Banksian Cabinet, was presented by
its learned and munificent possessor to the Linnæan Society of London,
where it still exists. The only published figure is that of Donovans, which
is much too small, and is otherwise faulty. The species is still very rare
in collections; our own, a fine pair, were received from Van Diemans Land.

Although unacquainted with the larva, and pupa state of this species,
nature has stamped the perfect insect with the image of that group she
intends it to represent. Its long, narrow, anterior wings, almost
transparent, immediately reminds even the unpractised entomologist of the
Heliconian butterflys; while the analysis of the genus _Papilio_, confirms
this idea, by shewing that _Cressida_ is the Heliconian type. We scarcely
need remind the student of the natural system that if our theory be
correct, this representation, under one form or other, will be found to
pervade every group of _Lepidoptera_. In all such as we have yet
investigated, this opinion has been fully verified.

Although of sombre colours, this butterfly is imposing in its size, and
highly interesting. It is, in fact, that form which is _pre-eminently
typical_ of the whole of the Latriellian _Papilionidæ_. It seems to be
common throughout India and particularly so in Java, from whence we possess
several specimens. Dr. Horsfield's elaborate work has furnished us with
figures of the caterpillar and chrysalis.

In now first defining some of the natural groups of the modern Genus
_Papilio_, it may be as well to state that we give the results of minute
analysis, the details of which we hope to lay before the public on a future
occasion. In regard to the nomenclature, we have adopted the following
principles, suggested to us by a scientific friend of no ordinary
authority, as tending to facilitate recollection, without altering well
known specific names. Each genus or sub-genus will be named after that
species which is its peculiar type; and the new specific name of this
species will imply one of its supposed natural analogies. Thus the
sub-genus _Protesilaus_, derives its name from the typical species, while
the specific name, now proposed of _Leilus_, points out the analogy of the
group to _Urania_ Fab. The sub-genus we now define, as being in our
estimation, pre-eminently typical, retains the name of the genus. It seems
also a geographic group, since all the species yet discovered belong to the
old world.

It is seldom we can deliniate more than the covering of testacious animals,
particularly where the species are natives of tropical countries. In the
present instance we owe this power to the singular fact of this snail
having survived a voyage from Jamaica, and peered out upon an English sun.
It is now near forty years ago since an intelligent correspondent of our
honoured father sent him from Jamaica, a box of land shells: they were
carefully packed in moist decayed wood, and enclosed the living animals.
The season was summer and the voyage short; the box was immediately opened,
and by placing the shells in luke-warm water, the animals of every one
slowly emerged from their shells. Of their ultimate fate we know not: but
that celebrated artist and entomologist, the late Mr. Lewin, then a guest
in the house, executed highly finished drawings upon vellum of each
species; and from one of these our present figures are faithfully copied.
At the request of our friend Dr. Leach, a copy was also made by some one
and transmitted to Baron de Fèrussac, for his great work upon Land shell,
where it will be found engraved at pl. 58. fig. 2. M. Guerin has re-copied
this latter figure, but as both are inaccurate, without any fault of these
gentlemen, (who never saw the original drawing of Lewin) we have now
represented it correctly.

The sultry groves of India are not without birds which recall to the
European the songsters of his own distant land. And although nature, in her
boundless profusion, has so distributed her productions that even the
little "Kitty Wren" may in vain be looked for beyond the confines of
Europe, its representative in the East is no less neat, active, and
familiar to the habitations of man. The _Prinia familiaris_, observes Dr.
Horsfield (whose politeness enables us to figure the bird), is abundant in
many parts of Java, near villages and gardens, in the confines of which,
among trees and shrubs, it builds its nest. Sprightly and active in all its
motions, it sports among the branches in short and rapid flights, and has
received its native name from its enlivening and pleasant notes. Our figure
is the size of life, and to avoid a tedious description, all the details
have been accurately measured.

We must refer the scientific Ornithologist, for our exposition of the
natural affinities of this group, to _Northern Zoology, vol. 2, p. 200_. It
is unquestionably the Rasorial and Scansorial genus of the Sub-family
_Sylvianæ_, as there pointed out, and of which _Orthotomus_ is a sub-genus,
or type of form.

The Butterflies of which we consider the species now figured as the typical
example, constitute one of the great natural divisions of the modern genus
_Papilio_; and they are peculiarly distinguished in all their three stages
of existence, namely in the caterpillar, the pupa, and in the winged state.
Dr. Horsfield has enabled us to illustrate the two former, and we add a
figure of the perfect butterfly from specimens in our own cabinet,
collected in Java. It seems subject to much variation in point of colour,
but we have strong suspicions that some of the varieties are distinct
species. The richness of the black resembles Genoa velvet, while that of
the yellow may be compared to glossy satin. All the larger species of the
group are Oriental, but we suspect America is not without typical examples,
although they are of a much smaller size. The species however, even with
these additions, are so few, that the sub-types of the group cannot be
accurately made out.

As this seems to be the pre-eminent type of the genus, we preserve to it
the generic name.

Achatinella is a very peculiar group of land shells, found only in the
Pacific Islands. They are all small, and so remarkably beautiful, that the
natives use them for ornaments. It was under this form that seven different
species came into our possession on the return of Captain, now Lord Byron,
from his voyage to the South Seas. As the systematic conchologist will find
them fully described in the Journal above quoted, we now only illustrate
them by figures.

We feel some surprize that Lamark should have viewed this large and
imposing _Murex_ as one of the varieties of _Saxatilis,_ from which it is
unquestionably distinct. It is by no means common, nor do we know its
precise locality.

In directing the attention of the philosophic Zoologist to the above
synopsis, we feel called upon to express our opinion on the unfortunate
Denis De Montford, whose labours, however honoured in his own country, have
neither been understood nor appreciated in this. We can say of him, what
can be said of very few, that he had an intuitive perception of natural
groups. And if we cannot place him on a par with his great rival Lamark, in
the extent of his researches, or the polished accuracy of his names, we can
safely affirm that in other respects, he is fully equal, either to him, or
to any of his successors.

There are some extraordinary analogies between the natural types of this
genus, and the series of vertebrated animals, which we cannot at present
develope. Nor can our doubts on the Sub-typical form, which we rather think
has not been discovered, effect any alteration of the series here pointed
out.

Among the most remarkable of those laws which belong to the natural system,
is that which assigns to every great division of our globe its peculiar
races of animals: and these in numerous instances, are so marked, that a
naturalist would no more expect to find such genera inhabiting a different
continent, than a Physiologist would hope to discover a race of Hottentots
among the Highlands of Scotland. It is under the tropical latitudes of the
old world (and chiefly those of Asia), that nature has placed the group of
butterflys which we now, for the first time, characterize. Distinguished,
in the most beautiful manner, by their larva and pupa, they shew, even in
the external appearance of the perfect insect, an unerring distinction, in
the dark stripes between the nerves of the anterior wings. We have indeed,
in the tropics of America, a race of black and crimson butterflys
representing these of India; but they belong to a very different group; and
are known at the first glance by their broader wings, totally destitute of
the stripes just mentioned.

M. M. Latrielle and Godart, are evidently mistaken regarding the insect
figured by Clerk, which they consider to be the female of _Polydorus_; this
error we have ascertained from fine specimens of both sexes, sent from Java
and now in our possession. We have figured the male, and Dr. Horsfield has
enabled us to add the Caterpillar and Chrysalis.

On the sixty-second plate of these Illustrations, we figured the female of
this elegant and highly interesting bird, from a specimen sent to us from
Mexico, by the late Mr. W. Bullock. We are now enabled to add the male from
a fine example, obligingly presented to us by John Taylor Esq. F. R. S. It
was killed near Real del Monte; and these, we believe, are at present the
only specimens that have reached England.

By viewing this as the type of the Scansorial group of the
Tyrant-flycatchers, (_Tyranninæ_) every circumstance, even the most minute,
regarding its structure and its colours will be explained. As representing
_Brachypus_, (North. Zool. 2. 485.) and its analogies, it has the under
tail covers richly coloured. As representing _Leiothryx_ (Il. 490.) it has
the same coloured cinereous and silky plumage: as a scansorial type, it has
a conspicuous although an _incumbent_ crest, and a long ornamented tail. It
is a Titmouse among the Tyrants, and is nearly as much of a _Ceblepyris_ as
of a _Tyrannus_. Indeed, when we described the female, we thought it
actually entered the circle of the former, but the laws of representation
has set us right on this point. _Phoenicornis_ is the first of the
_Ceblepyrinæ_, as _Philiogonys_ is the last of the _Tyranninæ_. The
_females_ of _Phoenicornis_ are clothed in the same slate coloured plumage,
but, as being of a _fissirostral_ type, their mouths are conspicuously
bristled, while those of _Ptiliogonys_ are quite smooth. Finally, the wings
are those of a _Ceblepyris_, but the tail that of a _Tyrannula!_

The pleasure which our scientific brethren will receive from possessing
this copy of Mr. Guilding's beautiful drawing, will be changed into regret
on knowing that the gifted hand which originally traced it is now cold. A
liver complaint, doubtless brought on by too much exposure to a tropical
sun, terminated the mortal career, a few months ago, of this accomplished
Zoologist and excellent man. The name of Guilding now belongs to posterity.
His loss, and that too in the prime of life, leaves a blank in the ranks of
science, which there is no one so qualified to fill; where can we look for
profound and indefatigable research, matured knowledge, a ready pen and an
exquisite pencil, all employed unceasingly to illustrate _from life_ the
animals of tropical regions. The search, unfortunately, will be fruitless.
May his spirit now be with that God whose minister he was, and whose works
upon earth it was his purest delight to study.

This noble species was discovered by Mr. Guilding, in great numbers, upon
the trunks and branches of trees in the forests of St Vincent: its eggs are
hard like those of a bird, and the young shell resembles that of a
_Succinea_. In _Carychium_ the eyes are at the _base_, but here they are at
the _tips_ of the tentaculæ.

We have searched in vain for some account of this very distinct and
handsome species, collected by our venerable and enthusiastic friend Dr
Langsdorff, in the interior of Brazil; and transmitted to us some years
ago, in remembrance of the many happy days we passed together in the
enchanting scenery of that delightful region. We have not seen the species
in any of the London collections, and we believe it altogether undescribed.

The Larva and pupa are of course unknown to us, but the whole structure of
the perfect insect agrees so truly with that of _Protesilaus Lelius_, that
we have no doubt whatever of its belonging to the same sub-genus, and thus
becoming an interesting addition to a group, capable of the most complete
and diversified demonstration.

We may term this the Javanese Swallow-tail, for in that and the other

elegant _Catalogue_ above quoted, for our figures of the _larva_ and
_pupa_; and to the rich collection of Mrs. Children for the examination of
the perfect insect.

Entomologists will doubtless feel surprize that this and the _Protesilaus_
on our last plate, should be placed as distinct types in two different
genera. We have not done this without long deliberation; but we cannot, in
a work of this nature, enter into those details which would demonstrate
these divisions to be truly natural, in the most rigid acceptation of the
word. We desire not, however, that Entomologists should adapt our
views,--at least for the present. We hope, indeed, that they will not,
because experience has shewn, that until a theory has been fully explained,
more injury than good results to science, from injudiciously adopting, and
hastily applying, a system not understood. We only desire, in short, to
record our views, that they may be comprehended hereafter. We consider this
as the Thrysanuriform type of the sub-genus, and our English _Papilio
Machaon_ of authors, as the Heliconian.--_Tempus ducamus._

There are only two collections we believe in this country, which possess
this rare and extraordinary butterfly, and it may be even doubted whether
these specimens do not belong to distinct species. One is in the Banksian
cabinet, now possessed by the Linnæan Society, the other in that of the
lady of our friend J. G. Children Esq. Zoologist to the British Museum. We
are told the species has been "made into a genus" by some continental
methodist, but who, according to the disreputable and slovenly mode fast
creeping _among us_, gives no definition. We have elsewhere expressed our
reasons for rejecting all such names (_North. Zool. 2. pref. lx._), and we
are thus pledged to do so upon every occasion.

Nature has so admirably disguised this insect in the external form of that
tribe of butterflys which she intends it to represent, that it was only
upon looking to its anatomical construction, that we discovered it was a
type of the true _Papilionæ_, and not of the _Erycinæ_. The construction of
the anterior feet, of the head and palpi, and of the antennæ, all which are
here represented, magnified, places this fact beyond doubt, and leaves us
nothing to desire but a knowledge of its caterpillar and chrysalis, and of
the direction of the wings when the species is at rest. We suspect that
like those of _Urania_, they are then _deflexed_.

We have already given the general reader some account of the manners of
these very singular birds, and we have said more upon them in _North. Zool.
Vol. 2_. Having figured the male on our 82nd plate, we now exhibit, in the
female, that remarkable difference between the sexes, which pervades all
the species. Our figure and specific character renders a detailed
description of the plumage unnecessary; it should be observed, however,
that the lateral tail feathers, in the female, are without those two black
transverse bands on the inner web, towards the tip, which are so
conspicuous in the male. There is another species from Mexico, which
country seems to be the most northern range of these birds. We feel
gratified at being able to characterize four typical forms of the genus;
all of which, at the same time, are marked by geographic peculiarities.

In a popular work like this, we wish to consult the taste of the amateur,
no less than of the philosophic naturalist; and with this object we have
delineated a beautiful variety, having the aperture rose colour, of the
_Murex imperialis_ already figured at pl. 67 of our second volume. It was
then in the possession of Messrs. Stuchbury, and was nearly the only one,
among very many of the usual orange-mouthed specimens, which came to their
hands.

We have already intimated that the series of types in this genus, (see pl.
100) besides possessing innumerable analogies in the class _Mollusca_,
exhibits a most singular one with the series of vertebrated animals; four
of which can be traced by comparing them with four of the classes of the
vertebrated circle. Commencing with _Phyllonotus_, we may call them, from
the hideous and repulsive aspect of many of the species, the _Reptile_
type, as the name given to one (_Murex scorpio_), sufficiently intimates.
In the tooth-like spines of _Murex tenuispinosus_ we see some resemblance
to the teeth of quadrupeds: the _Murex haustellum_ has been well compared
to the head of a snipe, while in the fin shaped varices of _Murex
pinnatus_, we have a representation of the _fish_. If the analogy between
_Centronotus_ and the _Amphibia_ cannot be traced, it is because the latter
has so few forms; but the Hedgehogs, which represent the _Amphibia_ in the
circle of Quadrupeds, are again represented under the form of a shell, in
the sub-genus _Centronotus_. These analogies, however remote are
unquestionably natural, _because they follow each other in a uniform
series_.

The perfect insect, or butterfly, of this elegant species we have already
figured at pl. 59 of our second volume: and that our illustration of a form
so interesting may be complete, we have now delineated the caterpillar and
the chrysalis, as given by Stoll; together with a sprig of the _Cashew_
tree upon which it feeds. Every entomologist, upon looking to the perfect
insect, will immediately be struck with its resemblance to the long-winged
Heliconian Butterflys, and to the genus _Euploea_, which is the Erycinian
type of that family. Now this resemblance, which hardly requires pointing
out, is a perfectly natural analogy; and is confirmed in the most
remarkable manner by the caterpillar, which puts on that peculiar form
which distinguishes _Euploea_. The species in short, in every stage,
exemplifies the truth of that fundamental law of nature which we have
elsewhere so fully illustrated, viz. "that every _natural_ group, contains
representations of ALL others in the same class," following each other
precisely in the same series: thus establishing a truth which has long been
suspected, but not before demonstrated, that the laws of variation are
precisely the same in every group throughout the animal kingdom. The genus
itself represents the Swallow-tailed types already figured (_Podalirius_,
_Protesilaus_, and _Leptocircus_), but of the three remaining sub-genera of
_Marius_, we are as yet ignorant. It is, however, by this genus that the
two sub-families of _Paphianæ_ and _Heliconinæ_ are united; as it blends
into the latter by means of the genus _Fabius_, which we shall shortly
illustrate.

No method is more calculated to demonstrate the existence of that
symbolical representation which reigns throughout nature, than that of
bringing before the eye of the student a series of forms belonging to
different families, but which are _disguised_, under an outward appearance
of general similitude; How few, even among professed entomologists, would
suspect that the present butterfly, and _Leptocircus Curius_, pl. 106, were
of totally different families: looking to their general aspect, as size,
form, and colour, we should even be tempted to place them in the same
genus; On closer examination, however, we find that one is a genuine
_Papilio_, and the other an _Erycina_; That this fact may be placed beyond
all doubt, we have given magnified details of both insects, which, from
their great rarity, will be highly acceptable to the Entomologist.

The specimen here figured is the only one we met with in Brazil, nor have
we seen the species in any other collection; Excepting the black bands and
the crimson spots, all the wings are transparent; the under surface being
similar to the upper. We possess the mutilated remains of a second species;
but we know not to what natural genus they belong.

The discovery of this remarkable and highly interesting Australian species
is due to Allen Cunningham, Esq. who, on an inland expedition ordered by
our government, in 1827, discovered it in small flocks on the arid sandy
plains between Lat. 29 and 28, 50. Long. 150¾ E. We must again express our
public thanks to this intelligent and liberal naturalist for the
ornithological specimens then collected. Among these were two skins of the
bird in question; but as the mere addition of a new species to our already
overwhelming list would be of little importance to the philosophy of the
science, we have hitherto refrained from publishing it. In truth, the
natural affinities of this extraordinary Cockatoo-Parrakeet called for a
much deeper investigation of the whole family than it had yet received, nor
are we ashamed to confess that nearly five years elapsed before we could
partially accomplish this, with any thing like satisfactory results. But we
regret not the delay, since it is obvious that the illustration of such an
apparently anomalous form as this, is infinitely more useful to science
than the specification, _in a few lines_, of a hundred new species, or even
of as many new genera, unaccompanied by analytical or comparative results.
The time, in fact, is now gone by, when such crude additions to
ornithological nomenclature, possess any claim to permanent interest, or
carry with them any authority: they encumber rather than advance science,
by keeping up the already overwhelming stock of undigested materials. Mr.
Lear has recently given beautiful figures of this species, but under the
peculiarly inappropriate name of _Palæornis Novæ-hollandiæ_. The genus is
_Platycercus_, _all_ the species of which are from New Holland, excepting
those of the Fissirostral type. The exactness of our figure renders a
detailed account of its plumage unessential.

Centronotus _radix_ was formerly a shell of excessive rarity, but many
specimens have latterly been brought from Panama; one of these, obligingly
lent to us by Mr. Cummin, we have here figured of the natural size.

We cannot too often place before the student those objects in nature which
seem more especially to illustrate that wonderful system on which the whole
has been created. In the infinite diversity which pervades the works of
"Him who made us," two things have obviously been intended: one, the
manifestation of His power in the creation of the individual: the other, an
illustration of some important truth connected with the spiritual welfare
of mankind. The first is manifest, and speaks to our senses: the second is
emblematical, and calls for an exertion of those reasoning faculties with
which the Creator, for such purposes, aided by those helps he has promised,
has given to us. In accordance with this latter assumption, both divines
and Naturalists concur in considering Nature as a book of Emblems, "where
one thing represents another." That this theory, resting heretofore on
general belief, is capable of mathematic definition, we have elsewhere
largely demonstrated, (North. Zool.). And if, as regards one division of
animated nature the theory is correct, it follows that it will be equally
manifested in _all_ other portions of the animal world, when they are
sufficiently investigated. Hence it is that remote resemblances between
objects, widely different in themselves, can be explained: hence the
analogy which the _Glires_ bears to the Hedgehogs, and to the
_Ceblepyrinæ_; and hence the resemblance between this shell and the
Porcupines; an analogy the more singular, as it extends even to the black
and white colour of the spines.

We believe the specimen from which our figures of this new and strikingly
distinct butterfly were taken, is the only one which has yet been sent to
Europe. It was captured by Mr. Cunningham, who accompanied Captain King, in
his voyage to the North West coast of Australia, on the skirts of Careening
Bay, Port Nelson, where the Ship Mermaid was hove down; and the officers
had more leasure to attend to zoological pursuits. Mr. Cunningham remarked
that it flew with great swiftness, in which respect it perfectly resembles
the rest of the genus _Jasia_, of which it is a typical example. The
geographic range of this group is thus proved to extend from the South of
Europe to Australia, but it is entirely unknown in the new world.

The family of _Nymphalidæ_ is the sub-typical group of the diurnal
Lepidoptera, forming our tribe _Papiliones_. In its own circle it therefore
represents the _Feræ_ among quadrupeds, the _Raptores_ among birds, the
_Aptera_ among annulose animals, and the _Scolopendridæ_ in the order
_Myriapoda_. The analogical representations resulting from this view of the
subject are innumerable.

Mr. Burchell was the first who discovered this unpublished species in the
interior of Southern Africa, and by his kindness we are enabled to
illustrate it. His specimens, unfortunately, are not in the best condition,
for he was obliged to preserve many of his insects in books; and these,
having been among the number, may probably have had the antennæ more
compressed than they were in nature. The form of this butterfly,
nevertheless, is perfectly distinct from _Colias_, as may be seen by
comparing the nerves of the anterior wings, here given in outline.

Not having completed our analysis of the _Colianæ_, we cannot speak with
any confidence on the rank or the station of this type; we are inclined to
believe it is a _genus_ between those of Colias and Terias, connecting this
sub-family with the _Licininæ_. It may, however, be one of the sub-genera
of _Colias_, in which case the genus, which it would then represent, is
unknown. Fig. 1. represents the anterior wing of _Teracolus_, 2, of
_Terias_, and 3, of _Colias_.

The diurnal or Heliconean Hawk-mouths, form one of the most natural and
remarkable groups among Lepidopterous insects. They fly during the heat of
the day; and, (as representing in their own family the tribe of
_Phalænides_) they have much of the general appearances of moths. In their
slow flight, long transparent wings, and proneness to imitate death on
being handled, they afford a most beautiful analogy to the Heliconian
Butterflys. Both have their chief metropolis in equinoctial America, and
both find their prototypes in the lovely family of _Erycinidæ_. It is
really surprizing that searchers after the _natural_ system, should have
overlooked such a group.

Among the comparatively few genera of this division, found in India and the
adjacent islands, is that now first defined: and we illustrate it by a new
and very rare species, even in its own country. It was twice seen by Mr.
Cunningham, on the North West Coast of Australia; once in shady woods
descending to the shores of York Island, and again in nutmeg woods
adjoining Brunswick Bay.

The form of the wings, which strongly resemble those of the sub-family
_Papilionæ_ will immediately distinguish this from all the American genera.
The plant, _Pattersonia glauca_, is of a sub-genus also peculiar to New
Holland.

For the use of this new and singularly formed bird, we are indebted to
Professor Hooker, who, with his usual liberality, has recently sent for our
inspection, a valuable box of Chilian birds, most of which are undescribed.
They form the foundation of his son's, Mr William Hooker's collection, who
has already commenced with much zeal the study of this interesting science.

All the rasorial characters are strikingly displayed in this extraordinary
type; which exhibits the greatest developement of the foot of any
insessorial bird yet discovered. It no doubt lives entirely upon the
ground; for the feet are formed precisely on the same model as those of
_Menura_ and _Orthonyx_, both of which are the rasorial types of their
respective circles, and are consequently representatives of _Leptonyx_: the
same analogy explains its resemblance to a partridge, and more distantly to
the sub-genus _Erythaca_ Sw. by its rufous breast.

The Indian bird erroneously called _Pitta thoracica_ by M. Temminck,
follows this in close affinity, and is either the Grallatorial type, or the
immediate point of connection between _Malacocircus_ Sw. and _Timalia_
Horsf.

It is somewhat surprising that the sedentary type of the genus _Arca_
should have been so long uncharacterized in our Conchological Systems;
seeing that the other four types, viz. _Arca_, _Pectunculus_, _Cuculloea_,
and _Nucula_, were defined many years ago by the celebrated Lamarck. We
have consequently supplied this omission; and at the same time have
selected a species hitherto, we believe, confounded with the _B. Noæ_; from
which it differs in sculpture, colour, and in the umbones being less remote
from each other.

The Animals of these shells affix themselves to other bodies by a
particular muscle, which is protruded through the gaping part of the
valves; they also adhere, when young, by the byssiform epidermes which
covers the exterior: a specimen now before us, which we procured in the Bay
of Naples, perfectly exemplifies this singular property. The present
species is not uncommon in the West Indies, and has been sent to us from
Jamaica. Like all others of this particular type it is almost constantly
covered by coralline substances.

This is one of the pretty warblers of Southern Africa, discovered by Le
Vaillant: it is very common and widely distributed in the interior, but
rare near the Cape. Le Vaillant mentions having found a young bird of the
Criard Cuckoo, in the pigmy nest of this little species, which had already
grown to the size of a thrush: it not only filled the nest, but actually
enlarged and destroyed its original shape. Yet still did the foster
parents, by a most extraordinary instinct, go on feeding this overgrown
parasite, although it was even then more than double the size of
themselves. Our figure is of the natural size of the male; the female is
without the black collar. Specimens are in Mr. Burchell's Museum and in our
own.

That this bird is of a tenuirostral type, is almost certain; seeing that it
is an obvious representation of _Motacilla_, _Pachycephala_, _Tamatia_,
_Trichas_, _Charadrius_, and many other collared groups: but whether it
forms part of the genus _Prinea_, or represents the tenuirostral genus
between that and _Culicivora_, is very uncertain. We suspect that this
latter station is filled by the Taylor-Warblers of India, not one of which
is to be found in our public Museums.

We have never seen specimens of this Butterfly from any other country than
China, although it appears that General Hardwicke has met with it in
British India, and has communicated a valuable drawing of the larva and
pupa to Dr. Horsfield, in whose interesting work it is engraved. To that
plate we must refer the entomologist who wishes to understand the previous
states of this insect; while its general aspect at once intimates its
resemblance or analogy to the Sub-genus _Idea_ F, and consequently points
it out as the generic type of that form in the circle of the _Papilionæ_.
According to these views, _Clytia_ is united to _Amphrysius_, by the
sub-genus _Epius_; (Pap. Epius. Auct.) and at the same time forms the
generic passage to the _Pieridæ_, Sw. For want of a better term, we must
call this the _Rasorial_ type, as it corresponds to that Ornithological
group.

The aberrant group of the Sub-family _Papilionæ_ appear to be the genera
_Leilus_, Sw. (_Uranea_ Lat.) _Antimachus_, Sw. and _Clytia_ Sw. the two
typical genera being _Papilio_ and _Amphrisius_, Sw.

We discovered this imposing species in the interior of Brazil, in 1814,
long before it was made known in France by the specific name we have
adopted. It is confined to the southern provinces; for we never met with it
north of the Rio St. Francesco. Although greatly resembling _Thoas Agavus_
and _Harrisianus_, (Z. Ill. 1 Series, pl. 109) it is at once distinguished
by the longer and more acute dentations of the inferior wings. The under
side shews no material difference from the upper. To the second type of
this subgenus belongs also _Ascarius_ L. _Polybius_ Sw. (Z. I. 1 Series,
pl. 137), and _Tros._ Fab. while _Dardanus_ F. probably connects this
American group with the third or _Paris_ type, whose geographic range is
confined to Asia.

In the fourth form (_Evander_), representing the Heliconian type, the tails
are obsolete, but they begin to appear again in the fifth, and thus
complete the circle of the sub-genus _Thoas_. By studying this natural
series, the Entomologist will discover a most beautiful set of analogies
between the genera _Papilio_ and _Amphrisius_.

This highly elegant and delicate species was first described by us in the
_Catalogue of the Bligh Collection_, at the sale of which a specimen
produced five pounds. Latterly, however, the species has become more
frequent: the figures are taken from a fine individual in our Museum,
procured from China. The pure white of the surface is relieved by a slight
iredescent or pearly gloss, similar to that on the scales of many fish: but
which is probably concealed, in a state of nature, by a thick and soft
epidermis, similar to that of _Triton corrugatum_, Lam.

The structure of this sub-genus is further remarkable for the prolongation
of the basal end of the principal varex on the body whorl, which, in nearly
all the species, is so prominent, as to give the shell an appearance of
having two channels. It is remarkable that this horn-like process occurs in
that part of the shell which is immediately above the head of the animal:
so that even in this genus of Mollusca we see a manifestation of that
principle of the natural system, by which one of the aberrant types of
nearly all animals have crests, horns, or similar protuberances on or near
the head.

this pretty and interesting group of shells. At present, we feel undecided
whether this is a species, or a variety of _A. bulimoïdes_, from which it

of orange yellow, fulvous, or white; we have figured a further variety of a
rich golden yellow with a chesnut line only at its suture: but in all these
the marginal groove is very close and distinct.

We now, for the first time, detach from the moth-like, or diurnal Sphinxes,
all those large and imposing species which are found in Tropical America;
and by comparing their characters with those of the Oriental group
_Helonia_, it will be seen how strikingly they differ. During our
researches in Brazil, the chief metropolis of this group, great attention
was paid to these insects, of which we have a most extensive series. They
fly slowly and heavily during the middle of the day, and on the least touch
counterfeit death. Most of the species, when handled, discharge from their
body a brown liquor, like their prototypes the _Heliconidæ_.

The Butterflys composing this remarkable genus are perhaps the most
splendid insects in creation. No art can effectually represent the
changeable and resplendent green which relieves the velvet black of the
wings, and which varies with every change of light. The typical species are
found in Tropical America, where they fly with amazing rapidity, and
perform, like their prototypes the Swallows, annual migrations. When at
rest, the anterior wings are flat or horizontal, but only slightly spread.
The present species appears confined to Surinam.

Modern systematists have been peculiarly unfortunate in the location and
construction of this group; while the name of _Urania_, bestowed upon it by
Fabricius, has long been appropriated to a genus of plants. Linnæus, more
correctly, placed it with the genuine _Papiliones_; a station which is
confirmed by the details of its structure: the anterior feet, like those of
_Leptocircus_, figured at pl. 106, being provided with that short spiney
process, which is a peculiar distinction of this sub-family. The analogies
which result from this location of _Leilus_ are beautiful, and almost

_Hesperidæ_ in its own circle; and of the fissirostral tribe of birds; all
these being modifications of the natatorial type of the VERTEBRATA.

This species, hitherto confounded with that peculiar to Surinam, is found
only in Brazil; but its precise geographic range, in that vast empire, has
not been correctly ascertained. We had the pleasure of capturing several
specimens in Lat. 8, 24, S. in the vicinity of Pernambuco, where great
numbers appear during the early weeks of May, and again in June.

On refering to our journals, we find the following note. "_Papilio
Leilus._--Great numbers of this insect were flying during the whole of the
morning, past _Aqua Fria_ (Pernambuco), in a direction from north to south:
not one deviated from this course, notwithstanding the flowers which were
growing around: they flew against the wind, which blew rather strong, and
near the ground, but mounted over every tree or other high object which lay
in their course; yet their flight was so rapid, that I could not capture a
single specimen. They went singly, and near fifty or sixty must have passed
the spot opposite the window, before mid-day: they continued to pass for
three or four days in this manner. 12th June, 1817." Now it is clear that
these insects could not have come from so far north as Surinam, where only
the other species is found; and they certainly do not migrate to the more
southern latitude of Rio de Janeiro. As we have never seen this species in
the London Cabinets, we have deposited a specimen in the British Museum,
that our entomologists may become acquainted with the structure of the
feet.

The Babblers, or long legged Thrushes, (forming the sub-family
_Crateropodinæ_, Sw.) are almost exclusively confined to the warmer
latitudes of the old world; extending to the north as far as Egypt, and to
the south over the greatest part of Australia. Like all birds which belong
to the natatorial type, the majority of the species live in the vicinity of
water. Their voice, like that of _Donacobius_, Sw. is particularly
discordant, and many of them appear to be gregarious. The present species
we received from Ceylon, but without any notice of its habits: another
specimen is in the Paris Museum, under the manuscript name of _Gracula
striata_, from the circumstance of the scapular quills, and also the tail
feathers, being marked with transverse lines of a darker brown, varying in
intensity according to the rays of light.

We have not yet sufficiently worked out this intricate and little known
group: the very existence of which was first announced in North. Zool. 2,
p. 156. According to our present views, the genera yet characterized appear
to be _Crateropus_, _Malacocircus_, _Pellornium_, and _Timalia_. To
_Crateropus_, we at present refer the sub-genera _Grallina_, Vieil,
_Cinclosoma_, H. & V. and _Aipunemia_, Sw.; while those of _Malacocircus_
are probably _Megalurus_, H. _Pomatorhinus_, H. and _Leptonyx_, Sw. Under
the genus _Timalia_, we place _Psophodes_ and _Dasyornis_, H. & V.

We feel much obliged to Mr. G. B. Sowerby for calling our attention to the
remarkable construction of this Volute Mitre, of which we had not then seen
a specimen. We view it as supplying that link of connection between the
_Volutinæ_ and the _Mitranæ_, the Volute and the Mitre shells, which we had
long been in search of. Of the genus, however, we know as yet but of two
species, represented on the plate somewhat larger than their natural size.
We have also added a figure of our _Mitra acuminata_, to shew how
beautifully _Mitreola_ is represented by the fourth type of the genus
_Mitra_, as now restricted, to which type (represented by _M. Zebra_),
_acuminata_ also belongs: both, as prototypes of the _Strombidæ_, have the
outer lip gibbous near the top; but the plaits of the pillar are totally
different, while the spire of one is acute, and of the other papillary. _M.
monodonta_ is a Grignon fossil: some specimens are so well preserved, that
the colours may be traced in the appearance of zebra-like stripes: thus
strongly corroborating our views on its true analogies.

Specimens of this rare and splendid species, sent to our museum from the
island of Jamaica, enable us to complete the illustration of the only three
American species of this type hitherto discovered. It is in all probability
the same as that figured by Cramer; particularly as his specimens came from
the same locality. Even a superficial comparison of this figure with those
on our two last plates, will shew the error of Fabricius and others, in
classing them all under the same name. We have represented the species in
that attitude which is assumed by _L. Braziliensis_, when at rest; the
wings of which species are sometimes _less_ but never _more_ expanded: the
fruit, upon which the insect is reposing, is the common West India
_Banana_, shewing its natural size.

In drawing the attention of Entomologists to the anatomical details of this
typical example of the genus _Leilus_, it will be readily perceived that
the obscurity which has involved its natural affinities, has entirely
arisen from ignorance of its structure. At a time when minute and obscure
Coleoptera are submitted to the most delicate dissection, under powerful
magnifiers, the LEPIDOPTERA, not only the most striking and splendid of all
insects, _but the pre-eminent type of the_ ANNULOSA, have been
comparatively neglected. We cannot otherwise account for this, but by
remembering that the influence of fashion is universal, and that she is
always followed by the majority. This exclusive devotion however, to one
order, is highly detrimental to the study of the natural system; or with so
many profound Entomologists who have gone before us, it would not have been
left for us to make known the fact, that the sub-family _Papilionæ_,
represents the sub-family _Harpalinæ_, (Harpalidæ, _Auct._) And that this
analogy is not only demonstrable by the peculiar construction of their
_tibiæ_, but by the parallel relations and by the circular affinities of
the COLEOPTERA and the LEPIDOPTERA.

----

That the natural affinities of this superb and highly interesting group of
insects should be no longer a matter of doubt, we are induced to deviate,
for the first time, from our usual practice. On this and the next plate we
have copied two figures of insects which we have never seen, for the
purpose of bringing them immediately before the eye of the entomologist,
and of clearing up some remarkable facts concerning them.

The first of these is taken from Cramer, who calls it _Pap. Rhipheus_, from
an unaccountable idea that it was the same species as one figured by Drury,
under that name. He imagines that this latter figure was made from a
mutilated specimen, in which the tails had been broken off, and that _his_,
consequently, represented the insect in its perfect state. Every succeeding
writer, so far as we can discover, has taken up this idea, without the
precaution of investigating its correctness. Now it follows that if the two
species were the same, the posterior wings of _Cramer's_, would be spotted
like those of _Drury's_, yet they are essentially different: a piece of
paper, put over to hide the tails in our present figure, which may then be
compared with the next, will at once explain our meaning: but setting this
aside, Cramer expressly asserts that his insect has the Antennæ "_sans
boutons_", and "_comme filiformes_", and very justly compares it with our
_Leilus Surinamensis_, "_mas plus encore_," with _Pap. Orontes_, L.
(_Orontes Noctuïdes_, Sw.) the immediate type to which it leads.

How totally inapplicable this account is to Drury's insect, will be
presently shewn. Cramer has most correctly given the immediate affinities
of this insect. We have no space to state our reasons for considering it,
at present, as a true _Leilus_; although with six tails, instead of _two_.
It may _possibly_, however, be the fifth, or natatorial type, which in our
synopsis of the genus at Pl. 125, we have not ventured to indicate. We have
never seen, or even heard of a specimen in modern cabinets; that figured by
Cramer, was found at Chandernagor, in Bengal, and was in the rich
collection of M. Gigot d'Orcy.

If the imagination was taxed to invent, or to concentrate into one figure
all that was splendid, lovely, or rare in the insect world, Nature would
far exceed the poor invention of man by the production of this incomparably
splendid creature; its rarity also is so great, that but one specimen has
ever been seen: this was brought from China, and in 1773, belonged to a
Captain May, of Hammersmith: with whom it was seen by Drury, and drawn by
Harris. It is not however, on this account only that we have been induced
to copy this figure, but because its illustration will clear up one of the
most intricate and perplexing questions, that has hitherto impeded the
natural arrangement of the Linnæn _Papiliones_, and even of the whole order
of Lepidoptera.

The error of Cramer, regarding _Rhipheus_ has already been rectified. It
will now be demonstrated that not only are the two insects distinct as
_species_, but that they actually belong to different _genera_. Cramer's
being a _Urania_ of Fabricius and Latrielle, while Drury's is a _Papilio_
of the same authors. This is proved by the figures; and confirmed by the
following words of Drury, "_The antennæ are black, and knobbed at their
extremities_," in other words, clavate; while the palpi, as expressed in
the figure, are so small as not to project beyond the head, where they lie
hid in the frontal hairs: this also being a typical distinction of the
Latrellian _Papiliones_. The figures in Drury's work were all drawn and
engraved by Moses Harris, well known as one of the most accurate artists
that ever lived: as a remarkable proof of this, we find that he has not
failed to delineate that peculiar nuration of the anterior wings, which
belongs only to the types of _Leilus_. A closer affinity therefore between
_Papilio_ and _Leilus_ cannot possibly be imagined: while its remarkably
hairy front, points out its analogy, as an aberrant type in its own genus,
to _Chlorisses_, among insects, and _Dasycephala_ among birds. So true it
is that the natural system "illuminates with a flood of light" every
supposed anomaly, and reconciles facts apparently the most inexplicable.

As considerable misconception appears to exist regarding the type of the
tenuirostral or vermiform family of the Diurnal Lepidoptera, we shall
endeavour to illustrate this subject. Our concluding number is accordingly
devoted to the genus _Polyommatus_ of Latrielle, and its subordinate types
or sub-genera. These compose, what we have elsewhere defined, a natural and
perfect group; (_North. Zool. 2, 288_) inasmuch as it has been tested by
the analogies, and conformed by the representations, which it bears to
innumerable others, both in the Annulose and vertebrated circles. According
to this analysis, both _Lycæna_ and _Polyommatus_, strictly so termed,
instead of being types either of families or sub-families, are of one and
the same genus: which genus, moreover, is but the portion of the aberrant
group of the _Theclinæ_. The typical forms of the genus _Erycina_,
exclusively confined to Tropical America, constitute, in fact, the
pre-eminent perfection of the family in question.

As _Lycæna_ represents the _Nymphalidæ_, or sub-typical family of the
Diurnal Butterflys, so is it the sub-typical form of the genus
_Polyommatus_. Its geographic range is wide, being extended to the
temperate latitudes of both hemispheres. The largest British species is
that now figured, from the identical specimens mentioned by Lewin.

We have elsewhere pointed out, as one of the peculiar distinctions of forms
and groups pre-eminently typical, that their geographic distribution is
invariably wide, and generally universal; and that this is one of the
reasons why certain forms are found both in Europe, America, India, and
Australia. This was said of Birds, and the remark is even more applicable
when we look to insects. We accordingly find, that the typical species of
the genus now under consideration, not only spread themselves over all
Europe and Africa, but extend to the Indian islands on one side, and over
the whole of America on the other, without offering more than a sectional
variation of character. It is uncertain, however, whether any species occur
in Australia; for the European type seems to be represented there by the
sub-genus _Erina_. The genus, _collectively_, is a rasorial type,
representing the family _Satyridæ_ among the _Papiliones_,--_Parnassius_
among the _Papilionidæ_,--and the _Paconidæ_ among Birds.

Pol. Cassius is one of the most common species of Brazil, where we found it
frequenting similar situations, and possessing the same habits, as the
ordinary Blues of England. The analysis bestowed upon this group, convinces
us that _Pithecops, H._ is but a section of this sub-genus. The upper
figure represents the male, the lower the female: both are enlarged. The
connecting species between _Polyommatus_ and _Lycæna_ are _Helle_, Hub.
_Lametia_, and _Boeticus_.

The passage from _Polyommatus_ to the type now before us, is distinctly
marked by the section (for under that rank we may still retain it), named
_Pithecops_; the palpi of these latter being both hairy, like the typical
_Polyommatus_, and squamose, as in _Erina_: the posterior wings of both are
also much of the same shape. By these blended characters Nature gently
glides into the form now under consideration, which is the satyrian or
_rasorial_ type of the genus; representing the _Satyridæ_, the
_Hipparchianæ_, &c. and which supplies the place of _Polyommatus_, strictly
so termed, on the Australian continent. We have already before us six
species from that country; five of which are typical, but the sixth, the
_L. ignita_ of our friend Dr. Leach (_Zool. Miss. I. pl. 60_), demands
particular attention. We have elsewhere shewn that all aberrant forms unite
into a circle of their own. Now as _Erina_, _Lucia_, and _Naïs_, are the
aberrant forms of the genus _Polyommatus_, so there should be species
either in the first or the last,--that is, in _Erina_ or _Naïs_, which
would exemplify this theory in the present instance. We accordingly find it
demonstrated by _Erina ignita_; for that insect, although essentially
belonging to this type, in the characters of the _palpi_ and _antennæ_,
nevertheless assumes one of the great distinctions of _Naïs_.---_The wings
of the two sexes being different_: the posterior pair in the female are
dentated, while those of the male are completely entire; so that the first
might pass for a _Naïs_, and the second for an _Erina_; both sexes further
shew the union of these two types, by having the under surface of their
wings ornamented, as in _Naïs_, with silvery spots. Our figures, by the
scale, are somewhat enlarged. We have sent a specimen of _E. pulchella_ to
the British Museum for general reference.

This, which appears the most aberrant type of the genus, immediately
reminds the student of a dark coloured _Erycina_ or a _Phalæna_, both of
which families, as being the Heliconian or Erycinian type of _Polyommatus_,
it truly represents. It is at once known from _Erina_, by its very peculiar
palpi, and by its more lengthened wings. The antennæ of three species now
before us, present a remarkable difference. In two of these, the club is
compressed and spatulate, like that of _Erina_; but in the third, here
figured, it has the cylindrical form belonging to _Naïs_. Which of these
forms is typical, must at present, be undecided; but there cannot be a
stranger link of connection between _Lucia_ and _Naïs_, than the fact of
this species borrowing, as it were, the cylindrical club of the latter.
Without such a link, in short, the series would be imperfect.

As we cannot satisfactorily determine whether the types here figured of
_Lucia_ and _Erina_ are described in books, we have been compelled to
regard them as unnamed. This, and the two other species we possess, are all
from Australia. On bringing the genus _Polyommatus_ to analogical tests,
the only demonstration of a natural group, we find the sub-genera
representing the families of the Diurnal Lepidoptera, in the following
manner:--1. TYPICAL, Polyommatus, _Papilionidæ_.--2. SUB-TYPICAL, Lycæna,
_Nymphalidæ_.--3. ABERRANT, Naïs-_Hesperidæ_, Lucia-_Erycidinæ_, and

In every natural group of the diurnal Lepidoptera which we have analysed,
(and the number is somewhat considerable,) there is always one in which the
posterior wings are more than usually tailed; and this seems to be such a
prevalent form throughout the Vertebrata and the Annulosa, that we believe
it is universal: in other words, that it is one of the PRIMARY TYPES of
Nature. We have consequently termed it the _natatorial_, since it
represents that order of birds, as the Swallow-tailed _Papiliones_ typify
the Swallows. That we should find this form in a group where the chief
character is the roundness and the integrity of the wings, is certainly
astonishing; but it shews that the laws of Nature are as simple, as they
are universal. The absolute union of this sub-genus with _Lycæna_, with
which we commenced the circle, is palpable to the meanest capacity. All the
species we possess, are from Africa and India. As they represent the
_Argynninæ_, we accordingly find them ornamented with silver spots. The
species now figured, are probably male and female, and were received from
Africa.

We have now given the natural types of an Entomological genus; the only one
that has been attempted, since the demonstration of _Phanæus_ and
_Scarabæus_. These are but three genera, out of many thousands, which at
present have any other foundation, strictly speaking, than mere opinion.
But the great principles of variation are now discovered, and we must hope
that those naturalists of a higher order, who join acknowledged talent to

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
