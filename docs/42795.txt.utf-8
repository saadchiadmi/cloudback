NAPOLEON A POET.

In a work entitled _Littérature Française Contemporaine_, vol. ii. p. 268.,
there is a notice of the Bonaparte family, in their connexion with
literature, in which it is stated that Napoleon, at the age of thirteen,
wrote the following fable:--

 "_Le Chien, le Lapin, et le Chasseur._
      César, chien d'arrêt renommé,
      Mais trop enflé de son mérite,
      Tenait arrêté dans son gîte
  Un malheureux lapin de peur inanimé.
  --Rends-toi, lui cria-t-il, d'une voix de tonnerre,
  Qui fit au loin trembler les peuplades des bois:
      Je suis César, connu par ses exploits,
      Et dont le nom remplit toute la terre.
      A ce grand nom, Jeannot lapin,
  Recommandant à Dieu son âme pénitente,
      Demande, d'une voix tremblante:
      --Très sérénissime mâtin,
      Si je me rends, quel sera mon destin?
      --Tu mourras.--Je mourrai! dit la bête innocente.
      Et si je fuis?--Ton trépas est certain.
  --Quoi? dit l'animal qui se nourrit de thym;
      Des deux côtés je dois perdre la vie!
      Que votre auguste seigneurie
  Veuille me pardonner, puisqu'il faut mourir,
        Si j'ose tenter de m'enfuir.
  Il dit, et fuit en héros de garenne.
  Caton l'aurait blâmé: je dis qu'il n'eut pas tort:
      Car le chasseur le voit à peine,
  Qu'il l'ajuste, le tire--et le chien tombe mort.
  Que dirait de ceci notre bon La Fontaine?
      Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera:
      J'approuve fort cette méthode-là."

The writer of the notice (M. Quérard) says this "fable" was composed by
Napoleon in 1782; and he thus explains the circumstances under which he
obtained a knowledge of it:

    "Cette fable a été imprimée dans un ouvrage dont nous ne pouvons donner
    le titre, parce que nous n'avons que le seul feuillet qui la contient.
    Nous ne savons aux soin de quel éditeur on doit de nous l'avoir fait
    connaître. Nous lisons au recto du feuillet en question, que, 'sans lui
    (l'éditeur), cette fable serait encore {302} perdue peut-être parmi les
    accidens ignorés de cette contrée rocailleuse (de la Corse).' Cet
    apologue n'étant que peu ou point connu, nous croyons faire plaisir en
    le reproduisant."

My own conviction is, that the greatest "fable" of all is the ascription to
Napoleon, at the age of thirteen, of a poem which would do no discredit to
an older and more practised hand. In his maturer years he wrote the
_Mémoire sur la Culture du Mûrier_, the _Lettre à M. Matteo Buttafuoco_,
the _Souper de Beaucaire_, and the _Discours_ upon a subject proposed by
Abbé Regnal to the Academy of Lyons; and these productions are confessedly
"au-dessous du médiocre." With what show of reason, then, can we accept him
as the author of a poetical effusion which, considering the age at which it
is alleged to have been written, would throw into the shade the vaunted
precocity of such professed poets as Cowley, Pope, Chatterton, and Louis
Racine?

But whatever may be the origin of this fable, the assigning of it to
Napoleon is in itself a singular circumstance. The dog César, who holds the
rabbit a prisoner in his "gîte," and who summons him to surrender; and the
unfortunate rabbit who prefers making his escape, "en héros de garenne,"
are so obviously applicable to the personal history of Napoleon, that it is
impossible to conceive how the French (except on the score of their
infatuation in everything that relates to that great man) could represent
him as the author of such a satire upon himself.

ST. COLUMBA'S CROSS.

In 1584 Sir John Perrot, lord-deputy of Ireland, writes to Sir Francis
Walsingham, the secretary of state:

    "For a token I have sent you holie Columkill's crosse, a god of great
    veneration with Surleboy {303} (McDonnell) and all Ulster; for so great
    was his grace, as happy he thought himself that could gett a kisse of
    the said crosse. I send him unto you, that when you have made some
    sacrifice to him, according to the disposition you beare to idolatrie,
    you maie if you please bestowe him upon my good Lady Walsingham, or my
    Lady Sidney, to weare as a jewell of weight and bignesse, and not of
    price and goodness, upon some solempne feaste or triumphe daie at the
    Courte."

Walsingham's daughter was married to the celebrated Sir Philip Sidney; and
afterwards to Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex; and, thirdly, to Richard De
Burgh, Earl of Clanricard, when she embraced the Roman Catholic religion,
that of her last husband, and may perhaps have regarded St. Columba's cross
with more veneration than did the rugged old Perrot.

It may be possible to trace out this ancient relique to its present
repository, if it be still in existence.

    "The archduke received the English ambassador (Edward Seymour, Earl of
    Hertford) with all honour and state; but whilest _they were feasting
    and merry at Brusselles_, Prince Maurice had an enterprize upon
    Antwerp, so that Spinola, Velasco, Van de Bergh, Busquoy, with many
    commanders, were forced to packe away speedily for the defence of the
    country."--Grimeston's _History of the Netherlands_, 1608, p. 1346.

W. M. R. E.

_Drawing an Inference._--The following is an amusing instance of false
inference, drawn through ignorance of the original. William Rae Wilson is
the innocent offender, in his _Travels in Egypt and the Holy Land_ (London,
Longmans, 1824, 2nd edition). The author remarks (p. 105.):

    "This I am inclined to believe was not the track which was taken by the
    Apostle Paul, when he went up to Jerusalem from the coast, as he
    appears to have travelled in some _conveyance moved on wheels_; for it
    is so far from being in any degree possible to draw one along, that, on
    the contrary, a great exertion is necessary for travellers to get
    forward their mules."

On referring to his authority for such an unapostolic mode of locomotion,
we find (Acts xxi. 15.) these words:

    "And after those days we took up our _carriages_, and went up to
    Jerusalem."

    "[Greek: Meta de tas hêmeras tautas aposkeuasamenoi anebainomen eis
    Hierousalêm.]"

The word "carriages" conveyed to the mind of our traveller the idea of a
"conveyance moved on wheels;" whereas our translators intended the term to
signify _anything carried_. Professor Scholefield, in his _Hints for an
improved Translation of the New Testament_, renders the passage, "We put up
our baggage." In fact, _carriage_, _luggage_, and _baggage_ may be termed
synonymes; for carriage = that which _is_ carried; luggage = that which
_is_ lugged; and baggage = that which _is_ bagged. The word "carriage" is
used in this sense, Judges xviii. 21., and again 1 Sam. xvii. 22.

_Edmund Spenser._--The subjoined paragraph from _The Times_ newspaper, the
readers of "N. & Q." may perhaps wish to find in a less voluminous journal,
but by biographers of Spenser more likely to be consulted.

    "_Edmund Spenser._--The literary world will be glad to learn that the
    locality of the illustrious author of _The Faëry Queen_ has been
    ascertained. Mr. F. F. Spenser, of Halifax, in making some researches
    into the ancient residence of his own family, has been fortunate in
    identifying it with that of the great Elizabethan bard, and, we are
    informed, is about to lay the particulars before the public. The little
    rural village of Hurstwood, near Burnley, in Lancashire, is the
    honoured locality; and in the romantic Alpine scenery of that
    neighbourhood it is probable Spenser took refuge when he was driven by
    academical disappointments 'to his relations in the north of England.'
    The family of that great poet appear to have resided at Hurstwood about
    four hundred years, that is, from the early part of the reign of Edward
    II. to the year 1690."--_The Times_, Wednesday, June 16, 1841.

_The Mint, Southwark._--In the year 1723, an act was passed to relieve all
those debtors under 50l., who had taken sanctuary there from their
creditors. The following curious account of the exodus of these
unfortunates, is given in the _Weekly Journal_ of Saturday, July 20, 1723:

    "On Tuesday last some thousands of the Minters went out of the Land of
    Bondage, _alias_ The Mint, to be cleared at the Quarter Sessions at
    Guildford, according to the late Act of Parliament. The road was
    covered with them, insomuch that they looked like one of the Jewish
    tribes going out of Egypt: the cavalcade consisting of caravans, carts,
    and waggons, besides numbers on horses, asses, and on foot. The drawer
    of the two fighting-cocks was seen to lead an ass loaded with geneva,
    to support the spirits of the ladies upon the journey. 'Tis said, that
    several heathen Bailiffs lay in ambuscade in ditches upon the road, to
    surprise some of them, if possible, on their march, if they should
    straggle from the main body; but they proceeded with so much order and
    discipline, that they did not lose a man upon this expedition."

THE SPECTRE HORSEMEN OF SOUTHERFELL.

On this mountain, which I believe is in the barony of Greystoke,
Cumberland, a remarkable phenomenon is said to have been witnessed more
than a century ago, circumstances of which appear to have been these:--In
1743 one Daniel Stricket, then servant to John Wren, of Wilton Hill, a
shepherd, was sitting one evening after supper (the month is not mentioned)
at the door with his master, when they saw a man with a dog pursuing some
horses on Southerfell-side, a place so steep that a horse can scarcely
travel on it at all; and they seemed to run at an amazing pace, and to
disappear at the low end of the fell. Master and man resolved to go next
morning to the steep side of the mountain, on which they expected to find
that the horses had lost their shoes from the rate at which they galloped,
and the man his life. They went, but to their surprise they found no
vestige of horses having passed that way. They said nothing about their
vision for some time, fearing the ridicule of their neighbours, and this
they did not fail to receive when they at length ventured to relate their
story. On the 23rd June (the eve of St. John's Day) in the following year
(1744), Stricket, who was then servant to a Mr. Lancaster of Blakehills,
the next house to Wilton Hill, was walking a little above the house in the
evening, about half-past seven, when on looking towards Southerfell he saw
a troop of men on horseback, riding on the mountain side in pretty close
ranks, and at the speed of a brisk walk. He looked earnestly at this
appearance for some time before he ventured to acquaint any one with what
he saw, remembering the ridicule he had brought on himself by relating his
former vision. At length satisfied of its reality, he went into the house
and told his master he had something curious to show him. The master said
he supposed Stricket wanted him to look at a bonfire (it being the custom
for the shepherds on the eve of St. John to vie with each other for the
largest bonfire); however, they went out together, and before Stricket
spoke of or pointed to the phenomenon, Mr. Lancaster himself observed it,
and when they found they both saw alike, they summoned the rest of the
family, who all came, and all saw the visionary horsemen. There were many
troops, and they seemed to come from the lower part of the fell, becoming
first visible at a place called Knott; they then moved in regular order in
a curvilinear path along the side of the fell, until they came opposite to
Blakehills, when they went over the mountain and disappeared. The last, or
last but one, in every troop, galloped to the front, and then took the
swift walking pace of the rest. The spectators saw all alike these changes
in relative position, and at the same time, as they found on questioning
each other when any change took place. The phenomenon was also seen by
every person at every cottage within a mile; and from the time that
Stricket first observed it, the appearance lasted two hours and a half,
viz. from half-past seven until night prevented any further view.
Blakehills lay only half a mile from the place of this extraordinary
appearance. Such are the circumstances as related in Clarke's _Survey of
the Lakes_ (fol. 1789), and he professes to give this account in the words
of Mr. Lancaster, by whom it was related to him, and on whose testimony he
fully relied; and he subjoins a declaration of its truth signed by the
eye-witnesses, William Lancaster and Daniel Stricket (who then lived under
Skiddaw, and followed the business of an auctioneer), dated 21st July,
1785. Mr. Clarke remarks that the country abounds in fables of apparitions,
but that they are never said to have been seen by more than one or two
persons at a time, and then only for moment; and remembering that Speed
mentions some similar appearance to have preceded a civil war, he hazards
the supposition that the vision might prefigure the tumults of the
rebellion of the following year.

My Query is, Whether any subsequent appearance of the same kind is recorded
to have been observed on this haunted mountain, and whether any attempt to
account for it on principles of optical science, as applied to a supposed
state of the atmosphere, has ever been published?

One is reminded of the apparition said to have been witnessed above
Vallambrosa early in the fourteenth century. Rogers, after mentioning in
the canto on "Florence and Pisa," in his _Italy_, that Petrarch, when an
infant of seven months old (A.D. 1305), narrowly escaped drowning in a
flood of the Arno, on the way from Florence to Ancisa, whither his mother
was retiring with him, says:

    "A most extraordinary deluge, accompanied by signs and prodigies,
    happened a few years afterwards. 'On that night,' says Giovanni Villani
    (xi. 2.), 'a hermit, being at prayer in his hermitage above
    Vallambrosa, heard a furious trampling as of many horses; and crossing
    himself and hurrying to the wicket, saw a multitude of infernal
    horsemen, all black and terrible, riding by at full speed. When, in the
    name of God, he demanded their purpose, one replied, We are going, if
    it be His pleasure, to drown the city of Florence for its wickedness.
    This account,' he adds, 'was given me by the Abbot of Vallambrosa, who
    had questioned the holy man himself.'"

This vision, however, without doubting the holy man's veracity, may, I
presume, be considered wholly subjective.

effect? and does it throw any light on that difficult passage, Gen. iv. 23,
24.?

    "And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice: ye
    wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my
    wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

    "If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
    sevenfold."

_Lord Chief Justice Popham._--C. GONVILLE says (Vol. vii., p. 259.) that
Raleigh Gilbert "emigrated with Lord Chief Justice Popham in 1606" to
Plymouth in Virginia. As this is a fact in the history of that learned
judge with which I am unacquainted, I shall be obliged to your
correspondent to favour me with some particulars. According to Anthony Wood
he died on June 10, 1607, and was buried at Wellington in Somersetshire;
and Sir Edward Coke (6 _Reports_, p. 75.) notices the last judgment he
pronounced in the previous Easter Term.

  A meeting of gentle lights without a name."

_Nelson Rings._--I am in possession of a ring, which in place of a stone
has a metal basso-relievo representation of Nelson (half-bust). The
inscription inside the ring is as follows:

   "A Gift to
    T. Moon
      from
  G. L. Stoppleburg
      1815."

The late Mr. Thomas Moon was an eminent merchant of Leeds, Yorkshire, and
the writer has always understood that the ring referred to is one of three
or half-a-dozen, which were made subsequently to Nelson's death, the metal
(blackish in appearance) forming the basso-relievo set in them, being in
reality portions of the ball which gave the late lamented and immortal
admiral his fatal wound at Trafalgar.

Can any of your readers furnish me with the means of authenticating this
supposition? likewise I should be glad to know if other similar rings are
at present in existence, and by whom owned.

_Dr. Fletcher and Lady Baker._--Dr. Fletcher, Bishop of London, married a

which marriage Queen Elizabeth being much displeased, the bishop is said to
have died "discontentedly by immoderate taking of tobacco." (_Athenæ._) Who
was the Lady Baker's first husband? Who was George Gifford? Was she a Roman
Catholic previous to her second marriage?

_Jeremy Taylor and Christopher Lord Hatton._--Bishop Jeremy Taylor, in his
dedication of the _Great Exemplar_ to Christopher Lord Hatton, entreats his
lordship to "account him in the number of his relatives." Was Jeremy Taylor
in any way connected with Lord Hatton by marriage? His first wife was a
Mrs. Joanna Bridges of Mandinam, in the parish of Languedor, co.
Carmarthen, and supposed to be a natural daughter of Charles I., to whom
she bore a striking resemblance. Do any of your readers know of any
relationship between this lady and Lord Hatton, or any other circumstance
likely to account for the passage above mentioned?

_The Left Hand; its Etymology._--I have read with much pleasure Trench's
_Study of Words_. The following passage occurs at p. 185:

    "The 'left' hand, as distinguished from the right, is the hand which we
    'leave,' inasmuch as for twenty times we use the right hand, we do not
    once employ _it_; and it obtains its name from being 'left' unused so
    often."

Now I should certainly be sorry to appear

 "Ut lethargicus hic, cum fit pugil, et medicum urget."

I am not the person to aim a word at Mr. Trench's eye. Although I am
Boeotian enough to ask, I am not too far Boeotian to feel no shame in
asking, whether it is quite impossible that "left" should be corruption of
_lævus_, [Greek: laios]. We have, at all events, adopted _dexter_, the
"right" hand, and the rest of its family.

_The Parthenon._--M. de Chateaubriand says that the Greek, Theodore
Zygomalas, who wrote in 1575, is the first among modern writers to have
made known the existence of the Temple of Minerva or Parthenon, which was
believed to have been totally destroyed. The _Messager des Sciences et des
Arts de la Belgique_, vol. iv. p. 24., corrects Chateaubriand, and says
that Ciriaco d'Ancona had, in the year 1436, described this celebrated
monument, together with other ancient buildings of Athens. I am desirous of
verifying this statement, and for this purpose beg the assistance of some
of your learned correspondents, who may probably be able to inform me what
is the title and date of the work of Ciriaco in which this description of
the Parthenon occurs.

MEDIÆVAL OR MIDDLE AGES.

(Vol. v., p. 469.)

The question there put by L. T. is still constantly asked, and the answer
given by a reference to Mr. Dowling's work may perhaps be unsatisfactory to
many, as not sufficiently defining the period at which the Middle Ages may
be said to terminate. By some of the best historical writers, the
commencement and termination are variously stated. In a work recently
published by George T. Manning, entitled _Outlines of the History of the
Middle Ages_, with heads of analysis, &c., the Querist seems answered with
more precision. Mr. Manning divides General History into _three_ great
divisions--Ancient History, that of the Middle Ages, and Modern History;
the first division extending from the Creation to about four hundred years
after the birth of Christ; the second from A.D. 400 to the close of the
fifteenth century of the Christian era; the third embracing those ages
which have elapsed since the close of mediæval times.

The Middle Age portions he divides into _five_ great periods, denoted by
the vast changes which took place in the course of that history, viz.:

  A.D.  400 to A.D.  800, _First Period_.
  A.D.  800 to A.D.  964, _Second Period_.
  A.D.  964 to A.D. 1066, _Third Period_.
  A.D. 1066 to A.D. 1300, _Fourth Period_.
  A.D. 1300 to A.D. 1500, _Fifth Period_.

The doubling of the Cape of Good Hope being the last important event, which
he places in 1497.

This is nearly the same view as taken by M. Lamé Fleury, who commences with
the fall of the Western Empire in 476, and closes with the conquest of
Granada by the Spaniards in 1492: thinking that memorable event, which
terminated in a degree the struggle of the Western against the Eastern
Empire, a better limit ("une limite plus rigoureusement exacte") than the
taking of Constantinople by Mahomet II. in 1453, the date when this
historical period is generally terminated by most writers.

Appended to this little volume is a list of remarkable dates and events, as
also of battles and treaties during the Middle Ages.

"GRINDLE."

(Vol. vii., p. 107.)

The question of C. G. supplies a new instance of an ancient and heroic word
still surviving in a local name. The only other places in England that I
have as yet heard of are, _Grindleton_ in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and
a _Gryndall_ in the East Riding. The authority for this latter is Mr.
Williams' Translation of Leo's _Anglo-Saxon Names_, p. 7., note 3.

In old England, the name was probably not uncommon: it occurs in a
description of landmarks in Kemble's _Codex Dipl._, vol. ii. p. 172.: "on
_grendles_ mere."

There is a peculiar interest attaching to this word; or, I might say, it is
invested with a peculiar horror, as being the name of the malicious fiend,
the man-enemy whom Beowulf subdues in our eldest national Epic:

 "W[=æ]s se grimma gæst Grendel háten,
  M[=æ]re mearc-stapa, se þe móras heóld,
  Fen and fæsten--fífel-cynnes eard
  Won-sæli wer...."
      _Beowulf_, l. 203. _seqq._--Ed. Kemble.

So he is introduced in the poem, when, in the dead of night, he comes to
the hall where the warriors are asleep, ravining for the human prey. The
following is something like the meaning of the lines:--

 "Grendel hight the grisly guest,
  Dread master he of waste and moor,
  The fen his fastness--_fiends among_,
  Bliss-bereft...."

This awful being was no doubt in the mind of those who originated the name
_grendles mere_, before quoted from Kemble. The name is applied to a
locality quite in keeping with the ancient mythological character of
_Grendel_, who held the moor and the fen. Most strikingly does the same
sentiment appear in the name of that strange and wildering valley of the
Bernese Oberland, in Switzerland:--I mean the valley of Grindelwald, with
its two awful glaciers.

But when we come to consider the etymology of the name, we are led to an
object which seems inadequate, and incapable of acting as the vehicle for
these deep and natural sentiments of the inhuman and the horrible.

_Grendel_ means, originally, no more than a _bar_ or _rod_, or a palisade
or lattice-work made of such bars or rods. Also a bar or bolt for fastening
a door, or for closing a harbour. Middle-aged people at Zurich recollect
when the old "Grindel" was still standing at the mouth of their river. This
was a tremendous bar, by which the water-approach to their town could be
closed against an enemy; who might otherwise pass from the Lake of Zurich
down the river Limmat, into the heart of the town of Zurich.

It was in Germany that this word lived longest as a common substantive.
There is no known instance of it in Anglo-Saxon, other than in proper
names, and of these I know no more than are already enumerated above;
whereas, in the Middle High German, it is by no means uncommon. It occurs
in a mystery on the resurrection preserved in this dialect, and edited by
Ettmüller, 1851 (_Dat Spil fan der Upstandinge_). I cannot now find the
line, but it is used there for "the gates of hell." Cf. also Ziemann's
_Mittelhochdeutsches Wörterbuch_, voc. GRINDEL.

Grimm, in his _Mythology_, establishes a connexion between _Grendel_ and
_Loki_, the northern half-deity half-demon, the origin of evil. He was
always believed to have cunningly guided the shaft of Flöder the Blind,
who, in loving sport, shot his brother Balder the Gay, the beloved of gods
and men. So entered sorrow into the hitherto unclouded Asaland.

Grimm draws attention to the circumstance that Loki is apparently connected
with the widespread root which appears in English in the forms _lock_ and
_latch_. Here is a very striking analogy, {308} and it is supported by an
instance from the present German: _Höllriegel_ = vectis infernalis, brand
of hell, is still recognised as = _teufel_; or for an old witch = devil's
dam.

And even in Latin documents we find the same idea represented. Thus, in a
charter of King Edgar (_Cod. Dipl._, No. 487.), which begins with a recital
of the fall of man, and the need of escaping the consequent misery, we have
the following:

    "Quamobrem ego Eadgar, totius Britanniæ gubernator et rector, ut hujus
    miseriæ _repagulum_ quam protoplastus inretitus promeruit ... evadere
    queam, quandam ruris particulam ... largitus sum," &c. &c.

As to the application of this name to localities, it seems to represent the
same sentiment as the prefix of Giant, Grim, or Devil: and this sentiment
would be that of the grand or awful in Nature, and mysterious or
unaccountable in artificial works. I think we may then safely conclude,
that all dikes, ditches, camps, cromlechs, &c., which have such titles
attached to them, date from an age previous to the Saxons being in England.
For example, if we did not know from other sources the high antiquity of
Wayland Smith's Cave in Berkshire, we might argue that it was at least
pre-Saxon; from the fact that the Saxons called it by the name of their
Vulcan, and therefore that it appeared to them so mysterious as to be
_dignus vindice nodus_.

If your correspondent C. G., or any of your readers, can, either from their
reading or from local knowledge, add any further illustrations or examples
of this ancient heathen word, I, for one, shall receive them gratefully.

MUMMIES OF ECCLESIASTICS.

(Vol. vi., pp. 53. 110. 205. 328.)

Although I have myself seen the natural mummies preserved at Kreuzberg on
the Rhine, I can say nothing more with regard to them, than vouch for the
accuracy of the accounts transmitted by your various correspondents under
this head. Your Querist A. A. however may, if curious on this subject, be
referred with advantage to Mr. T. J. Pettigrew's interesting _History of
Egyptian Mummies_. In chap. xvii. of this work, many instances are adduced
of the preservation of bodies from putrefaction by the desiccating
properties of the natural air of the place in which they are contained. He
says:

    "In dry, and particularly calcareous vaults, bodies may be preserved
    for a great length of time. In Toulouse, bodies are to be seen quite
    perfect, although buried two centuries ago. In the vaults of St.
    Michael's Church, Dublin, the same effect is produced; and Mr. Madden
    says he there saw the body of Henry Shears, who was hanged in 1798, in
    a state of preservation equal to that of any Egyptian mummy."

Garcilasso de la Veya, and more recent historians, may be referred to for
accounts of the mummy-pits of Peru, the dry air of which country is an
effectual preventive of the process of putrefaction. One of the most
curious spectacles, however, of this nature is to be found in the Catacombs
of Palermo, where the traveller finds himself in the midst of some
thousands of unburied bodies, which, suspended mostly by the neck, have
become so distorted in form and feature in the process of desiccation, as
to provoke an irrepressible smile in the midst of more solemn and befitting
contemplations. (Sonnini's _Travels_, vol. i. p. 47.; Smyth's _Memoirs of
Sicily and its Islands_, p. 88.)

Similar properties are also attributed to the air of the western islands of
Scotland. "To return to our purpose," says P. Camerarius (_The Living
Librarie_, translated by Molle, folio, London, 1625, p. 47.),--

    "That which Abraham Ortelius reporteth after Gyrald de Cambren is
    wonderfull, that the bodies of men rot not after their decease, in the
    isles of Arran; and that therefore they bee not buried, but left in the
    open ayr, where putrefaction doth them no manner of hurt; whereby the
    families (not without amazement) doe know their fathers, grandfathers,
    great-grandfathers, and a long race of their predecessors. Peter
    Martyr, a Milannois, saith the same of some West Indians of Comagra.
    These bee his words: 'The Spaniards being entered the lodgings of this
    Cacick, found a chamber fulle of dead bodies, hanging by ropes of
    cotton, and asking what superstition that was, they received this
    answer, That those were the fathers, grandfathers, and
    great-grandfathers of the Cacick of Comagra. The Indians say that they
    keep such relikes preciously, and that the ceremonie is one of the
    points of their religion. According to his qualities while he lived,
    his bodie, being dead, is richly decked with jewels and precious
    stones.'"

Many other instances might be adduced, but you will now think that at least
enough has been said on this subject.

VICARS-APOSTOLIC IN ENGLAND.

(Vol. vi., pp. 125. 297. 400.; Vol. vii., pp. 242. 243.)

Your correspondent A. S. A. seems very anxious to possess a complete list
of the vicars-apostolic of England. With their names, and the date of their
consecration and death, collected from various sources, I am able to supply
him.

The last survivor of the Roman Catholic bishops consecrated in England
prior to the reign of Elizabeth was Dr. Thomas Watson, appointed bishop of
Lincoln in 1557 by Queen Mary, and deprived (on the accession of Elizabeth)
in 1559. {309}

Upon his death, in 1584, the Catholic clergy in England were left without a
head, and the Pope some time after appointed an _arch-priest_, to
superintend them, and the following persons filled the office:

  _Consecrated._                              _Died._
     1598.  Rev. George Blackwell.
      --    Rev. George Birkhead               1614.
     1615.  Rev. George Harrison               1621.

On the death of the latter the episcopate was revived by the pope in
England, and one bishop was consecrated as head of the English Catholics.

  _Consecrated._                              _Died._
     1623.  Dr. William Bishop                 1624.
     1625.  Dr. Richard Smith                  1655.
     1685.  Dr. John Leyburn, with whom, in 1688, Dr.
  Giffard was associated; but almost immediately after
  this England was divided into four districts, and the
  order of succession in each was as follows:

BANBURY ZEAL, ETC.

(Vol. vii., p. 106.)

I have no doubt that the particular instance of _Zeal in the cause of the
Church_ at Banbury, which Addison had in mind when he wrote No. 220. of the
_Tatler_, published Sept. 5, 1710, was a grand demonstration made by its
inhabitants in favour of Dr. Sacheverell, whose trial had terminated in his
acquittal on March 23 of that year. And my opinion is strengthened by the
introduction almost immediately afterwards of a passage on the party use of
the terms High Church and Low Church.

On June 3, 1710, the High Church champion made a triumphal entry into
Banbury, which is ridiculed in a pamphlet called _The Banb..y Apes, or the
Monkeys chattering to the Magpye; in a Letter to a Friend in London_. On
the back of the title is large woodcut, representing the procession which
accompanied the doctor; among the personages of which the Mayor of Banbury
(as a wolf), and the aldermen (as apes), are conspicuous figures. Dr.
Sacheverell himself appears on horseback, followed by a crowd of persons
bearing crosses and rosaries, or strewing branches. The accompanying
letter-press describes this procession as being closed by twenty-four
tinkers beating on their kettles, and a "vast mob, hollowing, hooping, and
playing the devil." There is another tract on the same subject, which is
extremely scarce, entitled--

    "An Appeal from the City to the Country for the Preservation of Her
    Majesty's Person, Liberty, Property, and the Protestant Religion, &c.
    Occasionally written upon the late impudent Affronts offer'd to Her
    Majesty's Royal Crown and Dignity by the People of BANBURY and WARWICK:
    Lond. 8vo. 1710."

To your correspondent H.'s (p. 222.) quotation from Braithwait's "Drunken
Barnaby" may be added this extract from an earlier poem by the same writer,
called "A Strappado for the Divell:"

 "But now for Bradford I must haste away:
  Bradford, if I should rightly set it forth,
  Stile it I might _Banberry_ of the North;
  And well this title with the town agrees,
  Famous for twanging _ale_, _zeal_, _cakes_, and _cheese_."

A few words on "Banbury _Cakes_," and I have done. The earliest mention of
them I am aware of (next to that in Camden's _Britannia_, published by
Philemon Holland in 1608, and already referred to), is by Ben Jonson, in
his _Bartholomew Fair_, written 1614; where he introduces "Zeal-of-the-Land
Busy" as "a Banbury Man," who "was a _baker_--but he does dream now, and
see visions: he has given over his trade, out of a scruple he took, that,
in spiced conscience, _those cakes he made_ were served to bridales,
maypoles, morrisses, and such profane feasts and meetings." I do not know
whether the sale of Banbury cakes flourished in the last century; but I
find recorded in Beesley's _Hist. of Banbury_ (published 1841) that Mr.
Samuel Beesley sold in 1840 no fewer than 139,500 twopenny cakes; and in
1841, the sale had increased by at least a fourth. In Aug. 1841, 5,400 were
sold weekly; being shipped to America, India, and even Australia. I fancy
their celebrity in early days can hardly parallel this, but I do not vouch
for the statistics.

DR. SOUTH VERSUS GOLDSMITH, TALLEYRAND, ETC.

(Vol. vi., p. 575.)

This remarkable saying, like most good things of that kind, has been
repeated by so many distinguished writers, that it is impossible to trace
it to any one in particular, in the precise form in which it is now
popularly received. I shall quote, in succession, all those who appear to
have expressed it in words of the same, or a nearly similar, import, and
then leave your readers to judge for themselves.

I cannot help thinking that the first place should be assigned to Jeremy
Taylor, as he must have had the sentiment clearly in view in the following
sentence:

    "There is in mankind an universal contract implied in all their
    intercourses; and _words being instituted to declare the mind, and for
    no other end_, he that hears me speak hath a right in justice to be
    done him, that, as far as I can, what I speak be true; for else he by
    words does not know your mind, and then as good and better not speak at
    all."

Next we have David Lloyd, who in his _State Worthies_ thus remarks of Sir
Roger Ascham:

    "None is more able for, yet none is more averse to, that circumlocution
    and contrivance wherewith some men shadow their main drift and purpose.
    _Speech was made to open man to man, and not to hide him_; to promote
    commerce, and not betray it."

Dr. South, Lloyd's cotemporary, but who survived him more than twenty
years, expresses the sentiment in nearly the same words:

    "In short, this seems to be the true inward judgment of all our
    politick sages, that _speech was given to the ordinary sort of men,
    whereby to communicate their mind, but to wise men whereby to conceal
    it_."

The next writer in whom this thought occurs is Butler, the author of
_Hudibras_. In one of his prose essays on the "Modern Politician," he says:

    "He (the modern politician) believes a man's words and his meanings
    should never agree together: for he that says what he thinks lays
    himself open to be expounded by the most ignorant; and _he who does not
    make his words rather serve to conceal than discover the sense of his
    heart_, deserves to have it pulled out, like a traitor's, and shown
    publicly to the rabble."

Young has the thought in the following couplet on the duplicity of courts:

 "When Nature's end of language is declin'd,
  And men talk only to _conceal their mind_."

From Young it passed to Voltaire, who in the dialogue entitled "Le Chapon
et la Poularde," makes the former say of the treachery of men:

    "Ils n'emploient les paroles que pour _déguiser leurs pensées_."

Goldsmith, about the same time, in his paper in _The Bee_, produces it in
the well-known words:

    "Men who know the world hold that the true use of speech is not so much
    to _express_ our wants, as to _conceal_ them."

Then comes Talleyrand, who is reported to have said:

    "La parole n'a été donnée à l'homme que pour _déguiser sa pensée_."

The latest writer who adopts this remark without acknowledgment is, I
believe, Lord Holland. In his _Life of Lope de Vega_ he says of certain
Spanish writers, promoters of the _cultismo_ style:

    "These authors do not avail themselves of the invention of letters for
    the purpose of _conveying, but of concealing, their ideas_."

From these passages (some of which have already appeared in Vol. i., p. 83)
it will be seen that the germ of the thought occurs in Jeremy Taylor; that
Lloyd and South improved upon it; that Butler, Young and Goldsmith repeated
it; that Voltaire translated it into French; that Talleyrand echoed
Voltaire's words; and that it has now become so familiar an expression,
that any one may quote it, as Lord Holland has done, without being at the
trouble of giving his authority.

If, from the search for the author, we turn to consider the saying itself,
we shall find that its practical application extends not merely to every
species of equivocation, mental reservation, and even falsehood; but
comprises certain forms of speech, which are intended to convey the
_contrary_ of what they express. To this class of words the French have
given the designation of _contre-vérité_; and, to my surprise, I find that
they include therein the expression _amende honorable_. Upon this point the
_Grammaire des Grammaires_, by Girault Duvivier, has these remarks:

    "La contre-vérité a beaucoup de rapport avec l'ironie. Amende
    honorable, par exemple, est une contre-vérité, une vérité prise dans un
    sens opposé à celui de son énonciation; car, au lieu d'être honorable,
    elle est infamante, déshonorante."

I have some doubts as to whether this meaning of _amende honorable_ be in
accordance with our English notion of its import; and I shall be thankful
to any of your readers who will help me to a solution. I always understood
that the term _honorable_, in this expression, was to be taken in its
literal sense, namely, that the person who made an open avowal of his
fault, or tendered an apology for it, was acting, _in that respect_, in
strict conformity with the rules of honour. It is possible that, at first,
the _amende honorable_ may have been designed as a "peine infamante;" but
its modern acceptation would seem to admit of a more liberal construction.
{312}

There are other expressions, framed upon this "lucus a non lucendo"
principle, which may fairly be classed among _contre-vérités_. The French
say that a thing is _à propos de bottes_, when it is altogether
inappropriate. We all use the formula of "your most obedient, humble
servant," even when we intend anything but humility or obedience.

IRISH RHYMES.

(Vol. vi., pp. 431. 539. 605.)

MR. CUTHBERT BEDE (Vol. vi., p. 605.) says "he thinks A. B. R. would have
to search a long time, before he found, in the pages of Pope, such
brogue-inspired rhymes as _rake well_ and _sequel_, _starve it_ and
_deserve it_, _charge ye_ and _clergy_, and others quoted by him at p.
431." Among the latter, I presume he chiefly relies on the rhymes _satire_
and _hater_, _creature_ and _nature_.

Of all these I am able to adduce parallel instances both from Dryden and
Pope. And first, as to _rake well_ and _sequel_. MR. BEDE is, of course,
aware that these are double rhymes; that _quel_ and _well_ are good English
rhymes; and that the brogue betrays itself only in the first syllable of
each, _rake_ and _se_. It is, in fact, the same sort of rhyme as _break_
and _weak_, which is of such frequent occurrence both in Dryden and Pope.
Here is an example from each:

 "Or if they should, their interest soon would _break_,
  And with such odious aid make David _weak_."
                      _Absalom and Achitophel._

 "Men in their loose, unguarded hours they _take_;
  Not that themselves are wise, but others _weak_."
                      _Essay on Man._

The next "brogue-inspired rhyme" is _starve it_ and _deserve it_. Here, as
in the former instance, the last syllables rhyme correctly, and the
objection is confined to _starve_ and _deserve_. Let us see what Dryden
says to this:

 "Wrong conscience, or no conscience, may _deserve_
  To thrive, but ours alone is privileged to _starve_."
                      _Hind and Panther._

And Pope:

 "But still the great have kindness in _reserve_:
  He help'd to bury whom he help'd to _starve_."
                      _Prologue to the Satires._

Of this species of rhyme I have noted _three other_ instances in Dryden,
and _two_ in Pope.

As regards the rhyme _charge ye_ and _clergy_, no instance, in the same
words, occurs in Dryden or Pope. They did not write much in that sort of
doggerel. But the brogue, even here, is nothing more than the confounding
of the sounds of _a_ and _e_, which is so beautifully exemplified in the
following couplet in Dryden:

 "For yet no George, to our _discerning_,
  Has writ without a ten years' warning."
                      _Epistle to Sir G. Etheredge._

Next, we have the rhyme _satire_ and _hater_. The following in Dryden is
quite as bad, if not worse:

 "Spiteful he is not, though he wrote a _satire_,
  For still there goes some thinking to _ill-nature_."
                      _Absalom and Achitophel._

Of this rhyme _satire_ and _nature_, I can adduce two other instances from
Dryden.

In the same category we must place _nature_ and _creature_, _nature_ and
_feature_. Here is an example from Dryden; and I can bring forward two
others:

 "A proof that chance alone makes every _creature_
  A very Killigrew without good _nature_."
                      _Essay upon Satire._

And here is one from Pope:

 "'Tis a virgin hard of _feature_,
  Old and void of all good _nature_."
                      _Answer to "What is Prudery?"_

Can MR. BEDE produce anything to match the following sample of the
_crater_, to be found in our most polished English poet?

 "Alas! if I am such a _creature_,
  To grow the worse for growing _greater_!"
                      _Dialogue between Pope and Craggs._

It will be seen, from the foregoing quotations, that the rhymes described
as Irish were, a century and a half ago, common to both countries,--a fact
which MR. BEDE was probably not sufficiently aware of when he introduced
the subject in "N. & Q." For obvious reasons, the use of such rhymes, at
the present day, would be open to the imputation of "Irishism;" but it was
not so in the days of Swift.

HENRY H. BREEN.

St. Lucia.

In a former Number I drew attention to that peculiar fondness for "Irish
rhymes" which is more evident in Swift than in any other poet; and another
correspondent afterwards gave examples to show that "our premier poet,
Pope," sometimes tripped in the same Hibernian manner. In looking over an
old volume of the _New Monthly Magazine_, during the time of its being
edited by the poet Campbell, I have stumbled upon a passage which is so
_apropos_ to the subject referred to, that I cannot resist quoting it; and
independent of its bearing on our Irish rhyming discussion, the passage has
sufficient interest to excuse my making a Note of it. It occurs in one of a
series of papers called "The Family Journal," supposed to have been written
by the immediate descendants of the "Will Honeycomb" of the _Spectator_. A
{313} dinner-party is assembled at Mr. Pope's, when the conversation takes
this turn:

    "Mr. Walscott asked if he (Dryden) was an Englishman or an Irishman,
    for he never could find out. 'You would find out,' answered Mr. Pope,
    'if you heard him talk, for he cannot get rid of the habit of saying
    _a_ for e. He would be an Englishman with all his heart, if he could;
    but he is an Irishman, that is certain, and with all his heart too in
    one sense, for he is the truest patriot that country ever saw.... You
    must not talk to him about Irish rhymes,' added Mr. Pope, 'any more
    than you must talk to me about the _gods_ and _abodes_ in my Homer,
    which he quarrels with me for. The truth is, we all write Irish rhymes,
    and the Dean contrives to be more exact that way than most of us.'
    'What!' said Mr. Walscott, 'does he carry his Irish accent into his
    writings, and yet think to conceal himself?' Mr. Pope read to us an odd
    kind of Latin-English effusion of the Dean's, which made us shake with
    laughter. It was about a consultation of physicians. The words, though
    Latin in themselves, make English when put together; and the
    Hibernianism of the spelling is very plain. I remember a taste of it. A
    doctor begins by inquiring,

    "'Is his Honor sic? Præ lætus felis pulse. It do es beat veris loto
    _de_.'

    "Here _de_ spells _day_. An Englishman would have used the word _da_.

    "'No,' says the second doctor; 'no, notis as qui cassi e ver feltu
    metri it,' &c.

    "_Metri_ for _may try_.

    "Mr. Pope told us that there were two bad rhymes in the _Rape of the
    Lock_, and in the space of eight lines:

     "'The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;
      At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside.

      But this bold lord, with manly strength endued,
      She with one finger and a thumb subdued.'

    "_Mr. Walscott._ 'These would be very good French rhymes.'

    "_Mr. Pope._ 'Yes, the French make a merit of necessity, and force
    their poverty upon us for riches. But it is bad in English. However, it
    is too late to alter what I wrote. I now care less about them,
    notwithstanding the Doctor. When I was a young man, I was for the free
    _disinvolte_ way of Dryden, as in the _Essay on Criticism_; but the
    town preferred the style of my pastorals, and somehow or other I agreed
    with them. I then became very cautious, and wonder how those lines in
    the _Lock_ escaped me. But I have come to this conclusion, that when a
    man has established his reputation for being able to do a thing, he may
    take liberties. Weakness is one thing, and the carelessness of power
    another.'"--_New Monthly Magazine_, vol. xiii. (1825), pp. 551, 552.

With regard to the French rhyme, I see, in a note to _Odes and other
Poems_, by Henry Neele, 1821, that he apologises for rhyming _multitude_
with _solitude_, by saying:

    "It is of that kind which is very common in French, but I fear hardly
    justified by English practice. Still, 'La rime est une esclave, et ne
    doit qu'obéir.'"

I would append to this Note a Query. Where in Swift's works is the
"Latin-English effusion of the Dean's" to be met with?[2] or is it composed
for him by the writer of the article? I only know of two such effusions
really written by Swift; the _Love Song_, "Apud in is almi des ire," &c.,
and the _Epigram on Dic_:

 "Dic, heris agro at an da quarto finale
  Fora ringat ure nos an da stringat ure tale."

I should also like to know the author of the clever series of papers from
which I have quoted.

COUNT GONDOMAR.

(Vol. v., p. 489.)

Your correspondent W. STANLEY SIMMONDS will find a lengthy account of this
notable Spanish Don--Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, Conde de Gondomar--in the
_Nobiliario genealogico de los Reyes y Titulos de España_ of Lopez de Haro,
folio, Madrid, 1622, vol. i. pp. 236-238. In this notice he chiefly
figures, strange to say, as a military character! At the ripe age of
_seventeen_ this "famous captain" is said to have chastised the insolence
of that bold "English pirate, Francisco Draques," who in 1584 had had the
temerity to land somewhere near Bayona, his sole object being of course
plunder. Don Diego guarded well his territory of Tuy when the same
formidable "dragon," in the year 1589, made his appearance before Coruña;
and again in 1596, when the English Armada visited ill-fated Cadiz. Being a
person of "great parts," the Count was despatched to England as ambassador
in 1613, and during the five years that he resided in this country, "the
king and his nobility showered upon him favours and honours innumerable."
He once told James that the flour of England (meaning the gentry) was very
fine, but the bran (meaning the common people) was very coarse; "_La harina
de Inglatierra es muy delgada y fina, pero el afrecho es muy
grossero_,"--for Gondomar, like the learned Isaac Casaubon, had been
subject to the grossest insults from the London rabble. We next find ranked
among his praiseworthy deeds the following atrocious one:

    "Hizo cortar la cabeça al General Ingles Wbaltero Rale (Sir Walter
    Raleigh) por aver intentado descubrimiento en las Indias Occidentales
    de Castilla a su partida."

Another meritorious action is added:

    "A su instancia perdonó la Magestad de aquel Rey (James I.) a sesenta
    sacerdotes que estavan presos condenados por causa de la religion, y a
    otros mucho Catolicos, passandolos todos consigo a Flandes."

{314}

The title of Count Gondomar was conferred upon him by Philip III. in 1617,
but the date of his death is still a desideratum. Many anecdotes concerning

DOOR-HEAD INSCRIPTIONS.

(Vol. vi., p. 543.)

B. B. WOODWARD (urged, probably, by R. RAWLINSON'S question in Vol. vi., p.
412.) sends you the following inscription,

 "Sit mihi nec glis servus, nec hospes hirudo,"

copied from over the entrance to an old hostel in the town of Wymondham,
Norfolk. He says he quotes from memory.

Vol. vii., p. 23., you give an English translation of the inscription:

 "From servant lazy as dormouse,
  Or leeching guest, God keep my house;"

but suggest that "hirudo" should be "hiru_n_do," and produce some apt
classical quotations supposing it may be so, requesting MR. WOODWARD to
look again at the original inscription.

In a recent Number (Vol. vii., p. 190.) MR. WOODWARD appears to have done
this, and sends you the inscriptions correctly (as I beg to vouch, having
often read and copied it, and living within four miles of the spot), thus:

 "Nec mihi glis servus, nec hospes hirudo."

Permit me to add to this corroboration, that I should venture a different
translation of the word "hospes" from your correspondent's, and render the
notice thus:

 "Good attendance and cheap charges:"

taking "hospes" not as guest but host, and the literal words, "My servant
is not a dormouse, nor (I) the host a leech."

Ainsworth gives authority for "hospes" meaning host as well as guest, and
quotes Ovid's _Metamorphoses_ in support of it.

JOHN P. BOILEAU.

Ketteringham Park, Wymondham, Norfolk.

With due respect to your correspondent A. B. R., the word "hospes" most
probably means host, not guest.

 "Sit mihi nec servus glis, nec hospes hirudo."

In Blomfield's _Norfolk_ (but I cannot now lay my finger on the passage)
the line is given as an inscription on the lintel of a door of an ancient
hostelry, carved in oak. If so, the line may be rendered--

 "No maid like dormouse on me wait,
  Nor leech-like host be here my fate."

But, on the supposition that _guest_ is the proper meaning, "hirudo" might
be taken in the sense of a greedy guest, although this would not be
complimentary to the older hospitality. And even in the sense of gossiping,
"hirudo" would not be so inappropriate an imitation of the "recitator
acerbus" at the conclusion of the _Ars Poetica_:

 "Nec missura cutem nisi plena cruoris hirudo."

PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.

_Photographic Gun-Cotton._--The "doctors differ" not a little in their
prescriptions for preparing the best gun-cotton for photographic use. How
shall the photographer decide between them?

DR. DIAMOND ("N. & Q.," Vol. vi., p. 277.) says (I quote briefly), "_Pour
upon_ 100 grains of cotton an ounce and a half of nitric acid, previously
mixed with one ounce of strong sulphuric acid. Knead it with glass rods
_during five minutes_," &c.

Mr. Hunt, quoting, (apparently with approbation) from MR. ARCHER, says (p.
260., 3rd edit.), "Take one ounce by measure of nitric acid, mixed with one
ounce by measure of ordinary sulphuric acid, and _add to them_ eighty
grains of cotton; well stir," &c., "_for not more than_ FIFTEEN SECONDS,"
&c. "It will be seen that the cotton is not exposed to the action of the
mixed acids in this last mode longer than is necessary to saturate the
cotton; should the action be continued further, the solubility of the
cotton is entirely lost."

Not only is the order of manipulation different (a point probably not
material), but the time between "five minutes" and "fifteen seconds" must
exercise a most important influence on the result. Who is right?

COKELY.

_Sealing-wax for Baths._--I notice in your answers to correspondents (No.
176., p. 274.), that you inform H. HENDERSON that glass may be cemented for
baths with sealing-wax. May I recommend to H. HENDERSON the use of gutta
percha, instead of glass, for that purpose? Sheet gutta percha is now very
cheap, and the baths are most easily made. I have had one of my own making
in constant use since last July, having never emptied it but twice, to
filter the nitrate of silver solution. It is not liable to breakage. The
joinings are much less liable to leakage. And when it is necessary to heat
slightly the silver solution (as it has been during the late cold weather),
I have adopted the following simple plan: Heat moderately a stout piece of
plate glass; plunge it into the bath; repeat the operation according to the
size of bath. It is very useful to make a gutta percha cap to cover over
the bath when not in use; it protects it from dust and evaporation, and
saves the continual loss of materials arising from pouring the solution
backwards and forwards. For home-work I have reduced {315} the whole
operation to a very simple system. My bath, hypo-soda, developing fluid (of
which, as it keeps so long, I make ten ounces at a time), are always ready
in a small closet in my study. These I arrange on my study-table: a gutta
percha tray, a brass levelling-stand upon it, a jug of soft water, and
half-a-dozen small plates to place my pictures on, after treating them with
the hypo-solution (for, to save time, I do not finish washing them until I
have done all the pictures I require). All these things I can prepare and
arrange in less than ten minutes, and can as easily return them to their
places afterwards.

With regard to MR. MABLEY'S process, described in "N. & Q.," No. 176., p.
267., as I am but a beginner myself, and have much to learn, I should be
sorry to condemn it; but I should fear that his pictures would not exhibit
sufficient contrast in the tints. Nor do I see the advantage the pictures
would possess, if they did, over positives taken by our process. We
amateurs in the country labour at present under great disadvantages, some
of which I think the Photographic Society will remove. I am myself quite
unable to form an idea what the collodion pictures done by first-rate
photographers are like. All the positives done by amateurs in this part of
the world, and developed by pyrogallic acid, which I have seen, present a
dirty brown hue, by no means pleasing or artistic; and I have seen but very
few, either developed by pyrogallic acid or protosulphate of iron, free
from blemishes. I think if we were to act upon the suggestion made in "N. &
Q." some time back, and send the editor a specimen of our performances, it
would be a slight return for his endeavours in our behalf; and he would, I
doubt not, honestly tell us whether our pictures were tolerable or not. I,
for one, shall be very happy to do so.

_Developing Chamber._--I think MR. SISSON will find some difficulty in
applying his very excellent idea of a sheet India rubber lighting medium to
his portable laboratory, as the vapour of the ether will act upon it and
render it sticky and useless after one or two usings. Allow me to suggest
what I am in the habit of using, viz. a double layer of yellow glazed
calico, stuck together with a little common drying oil, and allowed to dry
for a few days: this causes a perfect exclusion of the actinic rays, and is
very durable.

_The Black Tints on Photographic Positives._--A correspondent having
inquired how these were obtained, and another replying that it was caused
by starch, I beg to offer a process to your readers as to how they may
obtain those carbonic tints; though I must premise that the process
requires some skill, and is not always successful, though always sure to
make them black: but on occasions of failure the lights sink, and the
brilliancy of the picture is lost. That it is not starch in the French
process, unless that vehicle contains some preparation, I am tolerably
certain; the chloride of barium will often produce black images, though
very uncertain; and the black process as given by Le Gray is uncertain
also. For myself, I generally prefer the colour given by ammoniac salt; it
is artistical and sufficient for any purpose. The present process, which I
use myself when I require a black colour, with its imperfections, I offer
to the photographic readers of "N. & Q.," and here it is.

Take a two-ounce vial, and have some powdered litharge of lead, by some
called gold or scale litharge; pound it fine in a Wedgewood mortar, and put
in the vial about one scruple; pour on it about half an ounce of Beaufoy's
acetic acid, but do not replace the cork or stopper, as the gas evolved is
very active, and will burst the vial, placing the operator's eyes in
jeopardy; agitate and allow it to stand some hours to settle, or leave it
till next day, when it will be better for the purpose: then decant the
clear part and throw the fæces away, return the solution into the bottle,
and fill up with distilled water. The positive paper being now prepared
with the ammonio-nitrate of silver, and placed as usual in the sun, the
artist must remove it when a tolerably distinct image is visible, but not
altogether up: this is _one_ of the niceties of the process; if it is too
much done the blacks will be too black, and if not enough they will be
feeble and want richness; it is when a visible image of the whole is
developed: at this point put the positive into cold water; this will remove
a great deal of the silver that has not been acted upon by the light: let
it soak three or four minutes; take it out and blot off the water, laying a
clean piece of paper below. Now pour a small quantity of the solution of
lead on one end, and with a glass rod pass it carefully over every part;
blot it off, and giving the paper a little time to dry partially, pass over
a solution of newly made gallic acid; the shadows will rapidly become
perfectly blank, and the picture will come up. But _another_ nicety in the
process is the point at which it must be plunged into hyposulphite of soda
solution; if plunged in too soon the black will be mingled with the sepia
tints, and if too late the whole tint will be too black. I offer it,
however, because I know its capabilities of improvement, and the intensity
of the black is sometimes beautiful: it is better suited for architectural
subjects, where there is but little sky, as it will lay a faint tint over
it; but if a sky is attempted, it must be kept under by a brush with a
little hyposulphite of soda solution, touching it {316} carefully. The time
it will take in becoming black will not exceed one minute; but as the
eyesight is the guide, the moment the tints have changed from red to black
is the proper time to arrest its further progress: the combination thus
obtained will not change, nor, I believe, become faint by time; but I
repeat it may be much improved, and if any abler hand, or one with better
means at his disposal, will take the trouble to examine its capabilities, I
shall be very thankful for his notes on the subject.

N.B. The solution of lead must contain acid; and if by keeping it does not
change litmus-paper, acid must be added till it does.

_Suicide at Marseilles_ (Vol. vii., p. 180.).--In Montaigne's _Essays_ I
find,--

    "In former times there was kept, in our city of Marseilles, a poison
    prepared out of hemlock, at the public charge, for those who had a mind
    to hasten their end, having first, before the Six Hundred, which were
    their Senate, given an account of the reasons and motives of their
    design; and it was not otherwise lawful than by leave from the
    magistrate, and upon just occasion, to do violence to themselves. The
    same law was also in use in other places."--Book ii. chap. iii., at
    end.

This, however, is not the original authority required by your
correspondent.

In the earlier part of the same chapter, "Plutarch, _On the Virtuous Deeds
of Women_," is referred to as the authority for the statement which
Montaigne makes of

    "The Milesian virgins, that by an insane compact hanged themselves, one
    after another, until the magistrate took order in it, enacting, that
    the bodies of such as should be found so hanged should be drawn by the
    same halter, stark naked, through the city."

_Acts_, xv. 23. (Vol. vii., p. 204.).--From the notes to Tischendorf's
_Greek Testament_, it appears that [Greek: kai hoi] is omitted by Griesbach
ed. II. anno 1806, as well as by Lachman, on the authority of the four most
ancient Greek MSS. distinguished as A, B, C, and D, confirmed by the versio
Armenica, and so quoted by Athanasius, Irenæus, Pacian, and Vigilius. The
MS. A is referred by Tischendorf to the latter half of the fifth century,
and is the Alexandrian MS. in the British Museum. B is the Vatican codex of
about the middle of the fourth century. C the codex Ephraemi Syri
rescriptus at Paris, and is of the first half of the fifth century; and D
is Beza's MS. at Cambridge, of about the middle of the sixth century. MR.
SANSOM may find a very interesting letter upon this subject from Dr.
Tregelles to Dr. Charles Wordsworth, the present Bishop of St. Andrew's,
which was published _very recently_ in the _Scottish Ecclesiastical
Journal_, and in which that learned critic defends the omission of the
[Greek: kai hoi]. I regret that I cannot furnish him with the number of
that Journal, but it was not more than three or four back.

I hope that MR. SANSOM will inform your readers of the ultimate result of
his inquiries on this interesting subject.

curious stones. Being principally found in Malta, it was said they were the
tongues of the vipers, which once infested that island, and which St. Paul

talismanic qualities, they were set in cups, dishes, knife-handles, and
other requisites for the table.

_Robert Dodsley_ (Vol. vii., p. 237.).--In the _Biographia Dramatica_ it is
stated that "this author was born _near_ Mansfield, in Nottinghamshire, _as
it is supposed_;" and this supposition was, {317} not improbably, founded
on the following lines, which occur in one of his poems, as Mansfield is
situated in the forest of Sherwood:

 "O native Sherwood! happy were thy Bard,
  Might these, his rural notes, to future time,
  Boast of tall groves, that nodding o'er thy plain,

_Lord Goring_ (Vol. ii., pp. 22. 65.; Vol. vii., p. 143.).--In the
order-books of the council of state, I find that William Killegrew was, on
the 1st Oct., 1642, appointed lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of Colonel
Goringh, _vice_ Thomas Hollis, deceased; and that, on the 26th March, 1647,
he was named colonel of the same regiment, vice Colonel Goringh, resigned.
That the last-mentioned colonel is _George_ Goringh we learn from the
war-budget (Staat van Oorlog) of 1644, where the salaries of

  Colonel George Goringh                   iij^c£
  William Killegre, Lieutenant-Colonel      lxxx£

are charged on the province of Holland. It nowhere appears from official
reports that Lord Goring held a higher military rank than that of colonel
in the Netherlands army. That he left England previous to 1645 is proved
not only by the above, but also by his presence, as colonel in the service
of Spain, at the siege of Breda in 1637. If he afterwards served in the
Spanish army as lieutenant-general, what could have induced him at a later
period to accept the rank of colonel in the army of the States?

not seem very clear. The register does not extend beyond the year 1730,
though there may be amongst the records of the office in St. Paul's some
earlier notices of similar appointments.

_The Duke of Wellington Maréchal de France_ (Vol. vii., p. 283.).--The Duke
of Wellington is indebted to the writer in the _Revue Britannique_ for his
dukedom and bâton of France, and not to Garter King-at-Arms. No such titles
were attributed to his Grace or proclaimed by Garter, as a reference to the
official accounts in the _London Gazette_ will show. The Order of St.
Esprit was the only French honour ascribed to him; that Order he received
and frequently wore, the insignia of which were displayed, with his
numerous other foreign honours, at the lying-in-state. Such being the case,
Garter will not perhaps be expected to produce the diploma for either the
title of _Duc de Brunoy_ or the rank of _Maréchal de France_.

_Lord North_ (Vol. vii., p. 207.).--MR. FORSTER has, it seems, blundered a
piece of old scandal into an insinuation at once absurd and treasonable.
The scandal was _not_ of Lord Guilford and the Princess Dowager, but of
Frederick Prince of Wales and Lady Guilford. On this I will say no more
than that the supposed resemblance between King George III. and Lord North
is very inaccurately described by MR. FORSTER in almost every point except
the _fair complexion_. The king's figure was not clumsy--quite the reverse,
nor his face homely, nor his lips thick, nor his eyebrows bushy, nor his
eyes protruding like Lord North's; but there was certainly something of a
general look which might be called resemblance, and there was above all
(which is not alluded to) the curious coincidence of the _failure of sight_
in the latter years of both. Lord North was the only son of Lord Guilford's
_first_ marriage: I know not whether the children of the _second_ bed
inherited defective sight; if they did, it would remove one of the
strongest grounds of the old suspicion.

_Mediæval Parchment_ (Vol. vii., p. 155.).--The method of preparing
parchment for illumination will be found in the _Birch and Sloane MSS._,
under "Painting and Drawing," &c., where are a number of curious MS.
instructions on the subject, written chiefly in the sixteenth century, in
English, French, and Italian.

Sir Frederic Madden, in the Introduction to _Illuminated Ornaments_, fol.
1833, and Mr. Ottley, in _Archæologia_, vol. xxiv. art. 1., have both
written very minutely on the subject of illuminating, but their
observations are too long for quotation.

E. G. B.

I remember reading in an old French work the process used in illuminating
parchments, and remember that the gilding was laid upon garlic juice; it
might very possibly be diluted with proof spirits of wine; at all events,
no parchments can bear water at whatever time they may have been prepared:
the process of making them wear out with water would turn them into
leather. The work I allude to was brought out, I recollect, under the
auspices of the French Academy.

_"I hear a lion," &c._ (Vol. vii., p. 205.).--These lines (corrupted by

question put by Colonel Titus in the debate on the celebrated bill for
_excluding_ James Duke of York.

C.

The _Art of Politics_, by the Rev. Mr. Bramston, contains the following
lines, which will, I apprehend, give your correspondent the required
information:

 "With art and modesty your part maintain;
  And talk like Col'nel Titus, not like Lane.
  The trading knight with rants his speech begins,
  Sun, moon, and stars, and dragons, saints, and kings:
  But Titus said, with his uncommon sense,
  When the exclusion-bill was in suspense,
  I hear a lion in the lobby roar;
  Say, Mr. Speaker, shall we shut the door
  And keep him there, or shall we let him in
  To try if we can turn him out again?"

Mr. Bramston's poem is in the first volume of Dodsley's _Collection_.

Perhaps some of your correspondents may be able to refer to a cotemporary
account of Colonel Titus's speech on the Exclusion Bill.

_Fercett_ (Vol. vi., p. 292.).--The term _Fercett_ is probably intended as
the _designation_ of some collection in MS. of family evidences and
pedigrees. It was usual among our ancestors thus to inscribe such
collections either with the name of the collector, or that of the
particular family to whom the book related. Thus the curious MS. in the
library of the City of London, called _Dunthorne_, and containing ancient
municipal records, is so called from its collector, whose name was
Dunthorne. Instances of such titles are to be found in the collections of
Gervase Holles in the _Lansdowne MSS._, where one of such books is referred

Scott, Ph. D., of St. Leonard's, Exeter, from the original work compiled by
his grandfather, Dr. William Scott, of Stamfordham, Northumberland, then
(1783) representative of the family. The latter gentleman left behind him a
large and valuable collection of MSS. relative to the family, which, as I
learn from the prospectus, will be called into requisition in the
forthcoming reprint of the _Old Souldier of Satchell_. Possibly the
publishers of the second and third editions may have been assisted in their
labours by the learned doctor in question, whose already quoted _Pedigree
of the Scotts of Stokoe_ was issued only a few years prior to the
appearance of the Hawick edition of 1786, not 1784, as accidentally
misprinted in J. O.'s interesting communication.

North America, where he laboured for several years. He removed thence to
Bermuda. In 1814 he returned to England with a constitution greatly
impaired, but continued to occupy regular stations under the direction of
the Conference until 1836, when, worn out by affliction, he became a
supernumerary, and resided in London, where he occasionally preached as his
health permitted. He died August 11, 1837, aged sixty.

A memoir and portrait of the Rev. Joshua Marsden will be found in the

    "In the fourth year of this king's (Edward VI.) reign, in the month of
    September, one Grig, a poulterer of Surrey (taken among the people for
    a prophet, in curing of divers diseases by words and prayers, and
    saying he would take no money), was, by command of the Earl of Warwick,
    and others of the Council, set on a scaffold in the town of Croidon, in
    Surrey, with a paper on his breast, wherein was written his deceitful
    and hypocritical dealings: and after that, on the eighth of September,
    set on a pillory in Southwark, being then Our Lady Fair there kept; and
    the Mayor of London, with his brethren the aldermen, riding through the
    fair, the said Grig asked them and all the citizens forgiveness.

    face to the horse-tail, the same tail in his hand as a bridle, a collar
    of jordans about his neck, a _whetstone_ on his breast; and so led
    through the city of London, with ringing of basons, and banished.'

    "Whereunto I had added (with the forementioned author) as
    followeth:--Such deceivers, no doubt, are many who, being never trained
    up in reading or practice of physicke and chirurgery, do boast to doe
    great cures, especially upon women; as to make them straight that
    before were crooked, corbed, or cramped in any part of their bodies,
    &c. But the contrary is true; for some have received gold, when they
    have better deserved the whetstone."--Goodall's _Royal College of
    Physicians_: London, 1684, p. 306.

_Surname of Allen_ (Vol. vii., p. 205.).--Perhaps A. S. A. may find the
following words in Celtic of use to him in his researches as to the origin
of the name of Allan:--_Adlann_, pronounced _all[=a]nn_, means a spearman
or lancer; _aluin_, a white hind or fawn (Query, Do any of the name bear a
hind as a crest?); _allin_, a rocky islet; _alain_, fair, bright,
fair-haired, &c.

_Belatucadrus_ (Vol. vii., p. 205.).--Papers concerning the god
Belatucadrus are to be found in the _Archæologia_, vol. i. p. 310., vol.
iii. p. 101., vol. x. p. 118. I take these references from Mr. Akerman's
useful Archæological Index.

_Pot-guns_ (Vol. vi., p. 612.; Vol. vii., p. 190.).--In the parish of
Halvergate, a train of seventeen pot-guns is kept at the blacksmith's shop.
MR. WOODWARD is correct in stating that they are "short cylinders set
perpendicularly in a frame, flat-candlestickwise;" but each pot-gun at
Halvergate is set in a separate block of wood, and not several in a frame
together. By touching the touchholes of each pot-gun successively with a
bar of red-hot iron, and with the aid of two double-barrel guns, a royal
salute is fired at every wedding or festive occasion in Halvergate.

_Graves Family_ (Vol. vii., p. 130.).--Your correspondent JAMES GRAVES will
find a tolerable pedigree of the Graves family, commencing in the time of
Edward IV., in the first volume of Dr. Nash's _Worcestershire_; and, in the
notes thereto, many interesting particulars of various learned members of
the family. Independent of the three portraits mentioned by your
correspondent, of which I possess fine proof impressions, I have also one
in mezzotinto of Morgan Graves, Esq., of Mickleton, county of Gloucester,
and Lord of the Manor of Poden, in the co. of Worcester.

_Portrait Painters_ (Vol. vii., p. 180.).--The name of the Derby artist was
_Wright_, not _White_. I have seen several portraits by him of great
excellence. The time of his death I do not recollect, but I think the
greater part of his works were executed in the latter part of the last
century. Have not some of them been exhibited in Pall Mall? I have not the
means at hand of ascertaining the fact, but I think he painted the
"Blacksmith's Forge," which was so admirably mezzotinted by Earlom.

_Plum Pudding_ (Vol. vi., p. 604.).--Southey, in his _Omniana_, vol. i. p.
7., quotes the following receipt for English plum puddling, as given by the
Chevalier d'Arvieux, who in 1658 made a voyage in an English forty-gun
ship:

    "Leur pudding était détestable. C'est un composé de biscuit pilé, ou de
    farine, de lard, de raisins de Corinthe, de sel, et de poivre, dont on
    fait une pâte, qu'on enveloppe dans une serviette, et que l'on fait
    cuire dans le pot avec du bouillon de la viande; on la tire de la
    serviette, et on la met dans un plat, et on rappe dessus du vieux
    fromage, qui lui donne une odeur insupportable. Sans ce fromage la
    chose en elle-même n'est pas absolument mauvaise."

Cheese is now eaten with apple puddings and pies; but is there any nook in
England where they still grate it over plum pudding? I have heard the joke
of forgetting the pudding-cloth, told against Lord Macartney during his
embassy in China. Your correspondent will find plum porridge and plum
puddings mentioned together at page 122. vol. ii. of Knight's _Old
England_.

_Muffs worn by Gentlemen_ (Vol. vi., _passim_.).--The _Tatler_, No. 155.,
describing a meeting with his neighbour the upholsterer, says:

    "I saw he was reduced to extreme poverty by certain shabby
    superfluities in his dress; for notwithstanding that it was a very
    sultry day for the time of year, he wore a loose great coat and a
    _muff_, with a long campaign wig out of curl," &c.

_The Burial Service by heart_ (Vol. vii., p. 13.).--In the Life of the Rev.
Griffith Jones, the celebrated founder of the Welsh circulating charity
schools, is this note:

    "Living amongst dissenters who disliked forms of prayer, he committed
    to memory the whole of the baptismal and burial services; and, as his
    delivery was very energetic, his friends frequently heard dissenters
    admire his addresses, which they praised as being extempore effusions
    unshackled by the Prayer Book!"

E. D.

_Burrow_ (Vol. vii., p. 205.).--BALLIOLENSIS says that in North
Gloucestershire "the side of a thick coppice is spoken of as a very
_burrow_ place for cattle." He understands this to mean "sheltered, secure
from wind;" and he asks to what etymology this sense can be attributed. I
suspect the Anglo-Saxon _bearo_, a grove or copse, is the word here
preserved. As a wood forms a fence against the wind, and is habitually so
used and regarded by the agricultural population, the association of ideas
is suitable enough in this interpretation. _Bearo_, first signifying the
grove itself, might easily come to mark the shelter which the grove
afforded. But there is also a compound of this word preserved in the
ancient charters, in which the fitness of a place as a pasture for swine is
the prominent notion. Kemble, _Cod. Dipl._, No. 288.: "Hæc sunt pascua
porcorum, quæ nostrâ linguâ Saxonicâ _denbera_ nominamus." In the same
sense the compound with the word _weald_ (= a great forest) is found:
weald-_bero_. The wood was considered by our forefathers as propitious to
their swine, not only for its shelter, but also for the masts it supplied;
and this may have further helped to associate _bearo_ with the comforts of
cattle.

ORIELENSIS.

"_Coming home to men's business_" (Vol. vii., p.235.).--It is hardly
requisite to state to the readers of "N. & Q.," that many editions of
Bacon's memorable, beautiful, and didactic _Essays_ appeared in the
distinguished author's lifetime, obviously having experienced (proved by
prefatory epistles of different dates) the repeated revision and
emendations of the writer. The _Essays_ were clearly favourites with him,
as well as with the then reading public. They were first published in 1597,
preceded by a letter addressed "To M. Anthony Bacon, his deare Brother."
The _ninth_ edition was issued the year before his death, which took place
April 9, 1626. In that edition is added a dedication "To the Right
Honorable my very good Lo. the Duke of Buckingham, his Grace Lo. High
Admirall of England;" signed, "FR. ST. ALBAN:" previous signatures being
"Fran. Bacon" (1597); "Fr. Bacon" (1612); "Fra. Bacon" (no date). In this
dedication to the Duke of Buckingham first appeared the passage inquired
about: "I doe now (he tells the Duke) publish my _Essayes_; which, of all
my other workes, haue beene most current: for that, as it seems, they _come
home to Men's Businesse and Bosomes_."--How accurate, yet modest, an
appreciation of his labours!

A HERMIT AT HAMPSTEAD.

My copy of Lord Bacon's _Essays_ is a 12mo.: London, 1668. And in the
epistle dedicatory, the author himself tells the Duke of Buckingham as
follows:

    "I do now publish my _Essays_; which, of all my other works, have been
    most current: for that, as it seems, they _come home to men's business
    and bosomes_."

This will carry J. P. eleven years further back, at all events.

RT.

_Heuristic_ (Vol. vii., p. 237.), as an English scholar would write it, or
_Hevristisch_, as it would be written by a German, is a word not to be
found in the sixth edition of Kant's _Critik_ (Leipzig, 1818), nor in his
_Prolegomena_ (Riga, 1783).[3] Your correspondent's copy appears to have
been tampered with. The title _Kritik_ should be spelt with the initial
_C_, and _reinen_ should not have a capital letter: the Germans being very
careful to prefix capitals to all substantives, but never to adjectives.
The above-mentioned edition of the _Critik_ was sent to me from Hamburg
soon after its publication. It was printed by Fröbels at Rudolstadt in
1818; and is unblemished by a single _erratum_, so far as I have been able
to detect one. Allow me to suggest to H. B. C. to collate the pages in his
edition with the sixth of 1818; the seventh of 1828; and, if possible, with
one published in Kant's lifetime prior to 1804; and he will probably find,
that the very favourite word of Kant, _empirisch_, has been altered in a
few instances to _hevristich_. MR. HAYWOOD is evidently inaccurate in
writing _evristic_, which is wrong in Greek as well as in German and
English.

Instead of giving the pages of his copy, your correspondent will more
oblige by stating the divisions under which this exceptional word occurs,
in the running title at the top of each page of his copy; together with two
or three lines of the context, which I can compare with my own copy. I
{321} have not here the facility of resort to a British Museum, or to
German booksellers. Should your correspondent find any difficulty in
effecting collation of his edition with others, I shall be willing to part
with my copy _for a short time_ for his use; or, if he will oblige me with
his copy, I will collate it with mine, and return it within the week with
the various readings of the cited passages.

_"Cob" and "Conners"_ (Vol. vii., p. 234.).--These words are Celtic. _Cob_
means a mouth, a harbour, an entrance. _Conners_ appears to be a compound
word, from _cuan_, a bay or harbour, and _mar_ or _mara_, the sea;
pronounced "Cuan wara," then shortened into _Conner_. Conna-mara, in the
west of Ireland, properly spelled _Cuan na mara_, means "bays of the sea."

_Lady High Sheriff_ (Vol. vii., p. 236.).--Your correspondent W. M. is
informed that in Duncumb's _Herefordshire_ there is no mention made of the
fact, that a lady executed the office of high sheriff of the county. The
high sheriffs for the years 1768--1771 inclusive were Richard Gorges,
William Nourse, Price Clutton, and Charles Hoskyns, Bart. The lady alluded
to would be the widow of one of these.

Anne Clifford, Countess of Dorset, Pembroke, and Montgomery, exercised the
office of hereditary sheriff of Westmoreland, and, at the assizes at
Appleby, sat with the judges on the bench (temp. Car. I.) Vide Blackstone's
_Comment_., and Pocock's _Memorials of the Tufton Family_, p. 78. (1800.)

I may add that ladies have also been included in the commission of the
peace. The Lady Bartlet was made a justice of the peace by Queen Mary in
Gloucestershire (Harl. MSS); Margaret, Countess of Richmond, mother of
Henry VII., was made a justice of peace; and a lady in Sussex, of the name
of Rowse, did usually sit on the bench at the assizes and sessions amongst
other justices _cincta gladio_ (_op. cit._).

_Death of Nelson_ (Vol. vii., p. 52.).--The "beautiful picture which hangs
in a bad light in the hall of Greenwich Hospital" was not painted by West,
but by Arthur William Devis, a very talented artist, but somewhat careless
in financial matters. He was a pupil of Zoffeny, was in India for some
years, where he practised portrait-painting with considerable success. The
well-known print of the "Marquis Cornwallis receiving the Sons of Tippoo
Saib as Hostages," was from a picture painted by him. The "Death of Nelson"
at Greenwich was a commission from the house of Boydell, Cheapside; and a
large print was afterwards published by them from it. Devis met the vessel
on its return to England, and on its way homeward painted, very carefully,
the portraits of the persons represented in his picture, and also a very
exact view of the cockpit in which the hero died. The picture has great
merit, and deserves to be better placed.

_Passage in Juvenal_ (Vol. vii., p. 165.).--The Delphin edition of Juvenal,
in a note on Sat. x. v. 365., says: "Sunt qui legunt, Nullum numen
_abest_." It would be very easy, in carelessly copying a MS., to substitute
either word for the other. When MR. J. S. WARDEN has ascertained which is
the true reading, he may fairly call the other an "alteration."

_Théâtre des Cruautés des Hérectiques de nostre temps_, Anvers, 1588; but
it is unfortunately very scarce.

PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES. _In consequence of the number of_ REPLIES TO MINOR
QUERIES _waiting for insertion, we have been compelled to postpone the_
REV. MR. SISSON_'s description of a new_ Head-rest, _and_ SIR W. NEWTON_'s
explanation of his_ Process.

A. S. K. (Worthing) _is informed that it is quite useless to extract the
size from the paper of positive pictures, to ensure their permanence. If
the hyposulphite of soda is entirely freed from them, they will bear any
exposure to atmospheric influence without change. Although in all works on
Photography it is recommended that the size should be extracted from
negatives before waxing them, it is a process we have entirely dispensed
with: if the iron is used sufficiently hot, the wax will perfectly permeate
the entire texture of the paper. Our Correspondent is referred to our back
Numbers for an account of the mode of taking a positive picture on glass
from a glass negative._

R. S. C. (Solihull) _shall receive a private communication on the subject
of the construction of his glass house for Photographic purposes. There are
points in it which are not generally attended to, and upon which the want
of success of many operators has no doubt depended._

TYRO (March 14th). _The second sample of collodion which you have used is_
over-_iodized. It is quite requisite that it should be known that the
sensitive properties of collodion are not increased by adding too much of
the iodizing solution. If the collodion is good, the film is
semi-transparent, of a bluish opal-like appearance. If the iodine is in
excess, it becomes more opaque and creamy after immersion in the bath, and
of a deep orange when looked through; whereas it should appear of a pale
amber colour._

TYRO (March 17th). _The reticulated appearance you complain of is from
using your collodion too thick, and not giving the glass the rotatory
rocking motion which you should do when you drain off the excess into the
bottle. Prepare two pieces of glass with collodion: in one simply drain off
the excess of collodion, and in the other use the motion which has been
before described, and you will perceive the difference in the evenness of
the two films._

H. HENDERSON (Glasgow). _We consider glass baths are much superior to gutta
percha in every respect. Many of the unpleasant markings in collodion
pictures may have their origin in the gutta percha. This is frequently
adulterated, and the nitrate acts upon the extraneous substances which are
added to the gutta percha, either for adulteration, to give it firmness, or
an agreeable colour. A glass bath is readily made, but the minute details
of the mode we cannot enter into. Our Correspondent is referred to our
numerous advertising friends, as the readiest way to supply his present
want in this respect. "Jefferies' Marine Glue" can be procured at all
times, the cost being about sixpence per pound. One part of marine glue,
and two of best red sealing-wax, form a beautiful cement for glass baths.
The marine glue, when used alone, becomes detached from the glass by the
nitrate solution; and, without a substance to temper it, the sealing-wax is
too brittle._

X. (Manchester). _When the blue spots occur of which our Correspondent
complains, it is because there is at the time of operating very feeble
actinic action in the light. If he were to rub one of these pictures when
dry, he would find it almost entirely removable from the glass. The
occasional want of brilliancy in all probability depends on the same cause.
Proto-nitrate of iron, when prepared with the nitrate of baryta of
commerce, instead of pure nitrate of baryta, will often have the same
effect._

    "It is perhaps hardly necessary to observe, that this work is of an
    Archæological, and not a Theological character. The Editor has not
    considered it his business to examine into the truth or falsehood of
    the legends of which he narrates the substance; he gives them merely as
    legends, and, in general, so much of them only as is necessary to
    explain why particular emblems were used with a particular Saint, or
    why Churches in a given locality are named after this or that
    Saint."--_Preface._

    "The latter part of the book, on the early Christian and mediæval
    symbols, and on ecclesiastical emblems, is of great historical and
    architectural value. A copious Index of emblems is added, as well as a
    general Index to the volume with its numerous illustrations. The work
    is an important contribution to English Archæology, especially in the
    department of ecclesiastical iconography."--_Literary Gazette._

* EXAMPLE.--At the commencement of the year 1841, a person aged thirty took
out a Policy for 1000l., the annual payment for which is 24l. 1s. 8d.; in
1847 he had paid in premiums 168l. 11s. 8d.; but the profits being 2¼ per
cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22l. 10s. per annum for each
1000l.) he had 157l. 10s. added to the Policy, almost as much as the
premiums paid.

The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident
Director.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
