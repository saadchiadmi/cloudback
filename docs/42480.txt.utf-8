TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.

(_By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller._)

I.--THE PINK HIPPOPOTAMUS.

The island of Seringapatam is without exaggeration one of the fairest
jewels in the imperial diadem of our world-wide possessions. Embosomed
in the blue and sparkling wavelets of the Pacific Ocean, breathed upon
by the spicy breezes that waft their intoxicating perfumes through
endless groves of gigantic acacias, feathery fern trees, and
gorgeously coloured Indian acanthoids; studded with the glittering
domes of a profusion of jasper palaces beside which the trumpery
splendours of Windsor or Versailles are but as dust, and guarded by
the loyal devotion of an ancient warrior race noted not less for
the supreme beauty of its women than for the matchless courage and
endurance of its men, the Kingdom of Seringapatam offered during a
period of more than one hundred years a stubborn resistance even
to the arms of the all-conquering Britons. So great indeed, was the
respect extorted from the victors by the vanquished that when, owing
to the marvellous strategy of my old friend Major-General Sir BONAMY
BATTLEHORN, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., the island was finally subdued, it was
agreed that in all but their acknowledgment of a British Suzerainty
and the payment of an annual tribute of fifteen hundred gold lakhs,
the proud islanders were to maintain their independence and to
continue those forms of government which long tradition had invested
in their eyes with all the sanctity of a religion.

I had been present with my dear father at the great battle of the Dead
Marshes by which the fortunes of the islanders were finally shattered.
Never shall I forget the glow of exultant gratitude with which towards
the end of the day gallant old Sir BONAMY came cantering towards me
on his elephant. "Thank you, thank you a thousand times, my dear
ORLANDO," said the glorious veteran as he approached me; "it was that
last charge of yours at the head of your magnificent Thundershakers
that has converted defeat into victory, and assured Westminster Abbey
to the bones of BONAMY BATTLEHORN. All that is now necessary," he
continued, rising in his stirrups and waving his sword, "is that you
should complete the work that you have begun. Dost see that battery of
fifty guns still served by the haughty remnants of the Seringapatamese
bombardiers? Let them be captured, and nothing will stand between us
and the Diamond City of the Ranee."

I needed no further incitement. Gathering round me the few
Thundershakers who had escaped unscathed, I bade the standard-bearer
unfurl the flag of the brigade. In another moment we were upon them.
Cutting, slashing, piercing, parrying, trampling, crushing, we dashed
into the midst of the foe. Far over the field of carnage sounded our
war-cry, the famous "Higher up Bayswater!" which was to our horses as
the prick of spur. In vain the doughty bombardiers belaboured us; in
vain did they answer with the awful shout of "Benkcitibenk," which
none hitherto had been able to withstand. The work was hot, but in
less than three minutes the battery was ours, and the broken host of
the Ranee was streaming in full flight down the slopes from which
so lately they had dealt death amongst the English army. In another
moment we had limbered up--two men to each gun, except the largest,
which was assigned to me as the chief of the band--and helter skelter
down the hill we went, and so, with shouting and with laughter,
deposited our spoils at the feet of the British General.

I do not recount this incident in order to magnify my own exploits.
My deeds themselves are my best record, those deeds which a factious
majority in successive Parliaments has, to its everlasting shame,
refused to recognise, but which not even the voice of malice, always
busy in the task of depreciating genuine achievement, can rob of one
particle of their brilliant and immortal lustre. But the fight is
indissolubly connected with the stirring story which I have here set
out to relate, and for this reason alone have I mentioned it. During
the brief struggle round the guns I became momentarily separated from
the main body of my men. Seizing the opportunity, and noticing,
too, that in the previous _melée_ I had been unhorsed, two gigantic
artillerymen made at me. My sword was broken, my revolver was empty!
What was I to do? But little time for reflection was left to me. With
savage shouts the two dusky Titans sprang upon me. I gave myself up
for lost, shut my eyes, thought of my poor mother, saw in a flash my
happy country home, the thatched roofs of the cottages, the grey old
church, the babbling stream, the village school, the little shop
where my infant mouth had first become acquainted with the succulent
bull's-eye--in short, I went through all the symptoms that are
understood to accompany the imminence of a violent death. Suddenly,
however, the desire to live awoke once more. The smaller of my two
foes had outstripped his companion. He was just about to seize me,
when, lowering my head, which was encased in a spiked helmet, I
bounded at him. Fair and full I caught him, and so terrific was the
force engendered by my spring and the foeman's rush, that not the
spike alone, but the helmet and the head too, pierced him through and
through.

[Illustration: "Fair and full I caught him."]

Down on his back he fell crashing, bearing me with him as he went over
and fixing the spike firmly in the earth, pinned like some huge beetle
by a human pin. As my legs flew up they encountered the second giant,
and, winding round his chest, crushed every vestige of life out of
him and flung his mangled body full twenty yards to the rear. I had
escaped, but my position was still uncomfortably awkward. By this
time, however, the rout was complete, and four of my men, by dint
of tremendous exertions, succeeded in extricating me from my curious
entanglement. My pinned foeman turned out to be the Ranee's brother,
HADJU THAR MEEBHOY. We bore him back with us to camp, where,
marvellous to relate, after a prolonged illness, he eventually
recovered.

Of course he has never been quite the same man since. He has to
be careful about his diet, but with the childlike simplicity of an
Oriental he finds a constant pleasure in opening and shutting the
little aluminium doors which our dear old surgeon, TOBY O'GRADY,
constructed to replace the KHAN's stomach and the small of his back. I
came to be great friends with him and it was through him that I gained
the knowledge which prompted the adventure I am now about to relate.

A WORD ABOUT THE ST. HENRY JAMES'S THEATRE.

There is something in a name, especially when it happens to be the
title of a play. At the St. James's, Mr. ALEXANDER'S latest venture
has been _Guy Domville_, by the American novelist HENRY JAMES, who
if he knew as much about play-writing as he does about novel-writing
would probably be in the first flight of dramatists; _and_ he would
not have chosen so hopeless a name for his hero and for his play as
_Guy Domville_. For the anti-James jokers would delight in finding
that _Guy could_ be "_guy'd_," and to say as to "_Domville_" that
"a first night audience '_vill dom_' the play." For all that, if
ALEXANDER be the sagacious commander in the dramatic field that he
has hitherto shown himself, it is not likely that he should have been
completely mistaken in accepting a play which a portion of the public
has refused to accept. Of course, a manager cannot afford to keep a
play going until the public come _en masse_ to see it, and therefore,
unless there is "a turn of the tide" (and such things have happened
before now, and a condemned piece has had a long and prosperous
career), Mr. ALEXANDER will himself be obliged to do to the play what
those who ridicule and chaff it have already done, _i.e._ "_take it
off_."

MRS. R. admits that she has always been very fond of sweets at dinner.
What she is especially fond of is, she says, "a dish of _pommes
d'Ananias_;" and she always adds, "But, my dear, why the French choose
such awful names for such nice things is what I never can understand."

THE DANDY AFGHAN KHAN.

(_Cabulee Version of a popular Comic Song._)

AIR--"_The Dandy Coloured Coon._"

_Ameer, dressing for a projected Visit, sings:_--

  Fools called me a mere "Nigger" when I felt Dame Fortune's frown;
            Up and down--I have known;
  But now the folks all say, "Why, you're fit to wear a crown.
            Black or brown--you've won renown."
  Now a lot of gossips they patter and spy.
  Someone says, "He wants to have the Muscovite hard by."
    "Muscovite!" said I,--"hard by!--you're mistooken!
  This Ameer wants to see no Muscovite.
            Not at all!--not a bit!--
  'Tain't for him at all the Afghan crown is meant!"
            "Go on!"--say they,--"Who is it?"

_Chorus._

  "Why, it's AB-DUR-RAHMAN, son of AFZUL, son of DOST
      MOHAMMED, means to rule the fierce Af_ghan_!
  Don't you know me?--Go on!--Well, you _will_, my good man,
  For I'm AB-DUR-RAHMAN the dandy Afghan Khan!"

  Now a man like me is a terror to the tribes,
            The Shinwaris,--the Ghilzais!
  And ISHAK KHAN and others found me galling to their kibes,
            When revolts--they would raise.
  They've been putting it about the Ameer is ill.
  (Wouldn't they delight to administer a pill!)
    "Ameer, you're ill--_mortal_ ill!"--but I wasn't!
  "You've palpitation," the quidnuncs state,
            "From your soles--to your scalp.
  ISHAK at Samarcand makes your heart palpitate!"
            "Go on!"--said I,--"nary palp!"

_Chorus._--For I'm AB-DUR-RAHMAN, &c.

  Now I've long had an ambition to far England for to go,
            Don't you know,--that is so!
  See Empress-Queen VICTORIA and Mister WALES also.
            I'm asked to go--to that show!
  The Empress-Queen to visit me doesn't care.
  (And doubtless Afghan fashions might make VICTORIA stare.)
    But there--I swear--I'll go!--and I'm going!
  Men may say "It's the Shah that this show's about!"--
            And another "You're an ass, Sir!
  'Taint the Shah-in-Shah at all--you're a long way out!"--
            "Go on!"--he'll say,--"ain't it NASS'R?"

_Chorus._--No, it's AB-DUR-RAHMAN, &c.

  So I'll dress the part as near as can be,
            Please JOHN B.--don't you see!
  My close-fitting lambswool and silver filagree,
            Empress V.--might find "free."
  Should the tribesmen twig this peculiar rig
  They'd think their Ameer had turned Infidel Pig.
    What a toff!--Well, I'll say--I'm here--to see the Empress!--
  What is that "coon" all the comics sing about?
            Mister BROWN--JOHN JAMES!
  If as to me Mister BULL has a doubt,
            Go on!--I'll say.--My names?

_Chorus._

  Why, they're AB-DUR-RAHMAN, son of AFZUL, son of DOST
      MAHOMMED, wearer of the Afghan Crown.
  Don't you know me?--Go on?--Well, you will very soon,
  For I'm AB-DUR-RAHMAN KHAN, the dandy Afghan coon!

THAT PRECIOUS DONKEY!

(_An Episode in the Life of A. Briefless, Junior, Esq.,
Barrister-at-Law, in Three Parts._)

PART II.--_The Passing of the Picture._

It may be remembered that the gift of my grateful if eccentric
client had been put in the box-room at Justinian Gardens. There the
presentment of the donkey languidly watching jaded villagers reposed,
amidst the possibly congenial surroundings of broken perambulators,
superannuated folding-doors, and half-forgotten wide-awake hats. I
rather regretted the fate of the picture, as it seemed to me that
it might have served as a not invaluable advertisement. As a large
proportion of the forensic world knows, I not infrequently during the
Yuletide season entertain some of my friends at the Bar, and I should
have been pleased to have been able to point to the canvas as a sort
of testimonial. However, the painting had disappeared, and there was
nothing more to be said about it.

I am reminded by this reference to my vacation entertainments, that
it was at one of "these feasts of reason and flows of soul" (as my
learned and distinguished friend APPLEBLOSSOM, Q.C., is kind enough
to call them) that my fortunes underwent a change for the better.
The inhabitants of Justinian Gardens are accustomed to do things very
well. When there is a ball, the number of vehicles (always with one
horse apiece, and sometimes with a pair) is quite considerable. On
such occasions a stranger might imagine that the Gardens had the
advantage of a chronic cab-stand. At 97 (which I think I may describe
as our show-house) there is a butler, and there are few at Justinian
Gardens who cannot boast of a "buttons." I do not secure the services
of a man-retainer myself, and am consequently not quite in the
fashion. However, when I entertain, I do my best to be worthy of the
_prestige_ of my neighbours, and put forth all my strength in making
my house an object of interest. The walls of my modest dwelling-place
are adorned with several mementoes of my not-altogether-common-place
career. For instance, I have had my commission as a Lieutenant of
Volunteers (I served for many years in the Bishop's Own, and was
graciously permitted by Her Majesty to retire with my rank) glazed and
framed, and have treated the pasteboard distinctions I won at school
in a similar fashion. When I purpose entertaining my friends at the
Bar, I have these gratifying landmarks in my life's history polished
up by an individual known in my household as "the handy man." This
person (towards whom I entertain a friendly regard), for a certain
sum an hour undertakes to do anything I require. I believe that he
can paint a house, build a conservatory, cut down a forest, and
reconstruct an aquarium with equal facility. But it is only right
to say that I make this statement on the faith of his guarantor--the
gentleman who was good enough to procure for me the advantage of his
services--and cannot speak from personal knowledge. So far I have only
had the opportunity of testing his capabilities in window-cleaning and
the dusting of works of art. In performing these domestic duties he
shows great energy, and even daring. He seems to delight in standing
on window-ledges and the outer edges of flights of stairs. I have been
given to understand that he glories in these displays of hardihood,
as they remind him of the days and nights when he acted as a rather
prominent member of the Fire Brigade.

"Mr. WILKINS," I said, on my departure for the Temple, "I shall esteem
it a favour if you will be so good as to employ your leisure to-day in
repainting the waterbutts, sweeping the kitchen chimney, putting glass
in the conservatory, regilding the mirror in the study, and, if you
have time, dusting my testimonial."

"Certainly, Sir," replied my valued acquaintance, and before I had
closed the hall door, the sounds of the rumbling sticks told me that
he had already commenced to remove the superfluous soot from the
culinary smoke-hole.

I had rather an arduous day at Pump-Handle Court. I had quite an
accumulation of circulars, and a consent brief that required very
careful attention. The latter was not endorsed with my name, but I saw
to it on behalf of a colleague. After I had spent some hours in
the little frequented (during the vacation) realms of the Temple,
I returned to Justinian Gardens, which I need scarcely tell an
experienced cabman is in the neighbourhood of that continually rising
locality--Earl's Court. The door was opened by Mr. WILKINS in person,
who anticipated the turning of the proprietorial latch-key.

"I am sorry to say, Sir," said my trusted _employé_, "that I have had
an accident. While I was dusting the military enlistment card----"

"You mean my commission?"

"I do, Sir. It came down with a run. You see, Sir, you have had him
rather heavily framed. Unfortunately, Sir, when I passed the polish
brush over him the nail did not hold, and it gave suddenly. The
picture made a nasty mark on the wall, and smashed up when he got to
the flooring. I would have reframed him, but all the shops close early
on a Thursday, and I can get no glass."

"Well, what have you done?" I asked, in a tone of some annoyance,
for I pride myself on my commission, and am proud of showing it to my
friends.

"Well, Sir, I went up to the box-room to see if I could find anything
that would do, and have looked up an affair that I think will meet
with your approval."

By this time I had reached the place where the wall was damaged. The
spot was covered by a picture.

"I did my best, Sir. I washed the canvas with soap and water, and put
the polishing brush over the frame. Of course the subject ain't worth
much, but for a stop-gap it isn't bad. Now is it?"

I then found that Mr. WILKINS had hidden the faulty hall paper with
the picture that had been presented to me by the gentleman who had
raised a claim to the throne of the Celestial Empire. Secretly pleased
that I could now have an opportunity of referring to the gratitude of
my client to my learned and distinguished friend, APPLEBLOSSOM, Q.C.,
who had promised to dine with me that evening, I readily accepted the
apologies of the penitent WILKINS.

"I will put it allright to-morrow, Sir," said my distressed _employé_.
"I will get some glass, fix up your enlistment card, and have it
done before I rebuild the pantry and whitewash the ceiling of the
bath-room."

Satisfied with the promise I thought no more of the _contretemps_
until after dinner, when my attention was directed to it by
APPLEBLOSSOM, Q.C., who had made himself vastly agreeable after the
ladies had retired and left us to discuss the chestnuts and the port.

"Hullo, BRIEFLESS," he exclaimed; "where did you get that Old BOOTS?"

I told my story of the grateful client, and young BANDS, who I fancy
is thinking of reading in my chambers, regarded me (I venture to
believe) with increased respect.

"Bless me, you have a treasure!" continued APPLEBLOSSOM, Q.C., who
seemed wrapt in admiration. "That is a genuine Old BOOTS. You can
always tell him from Young BOOTS by the manipulation of his animal's
ears. Look at those, Sir! Splendid! Why, who could paint a donkey like
that? By Jove, BRIEFLESS, you are in luck! You ought to make a fortune
out of it at CHRISTIES!"

"Why, is it very valuable?" I asked. "I am not much of an art
connoisseur, and I frankly confess I know very little of Old SHOES."

"Old BOOTS, Sir!" cried APPLEBLOSSOM, Q.C. "Why I thought all the
world knew Old BOOTS! One of the grandest painters of the eighteenth
century! He got that particular delicacy of touch which you can trace
in that donkey's ears by never commencing to paint his animals until
he was recovering from _delirium tremens_. Why, Sir, that animal is
simply superb. Look at his mane, Sir! Why, it is simply marvellous!"

I did look at the donkey's ears and mane, and, with the assistance
of young BANDS, went into an ecstasy. The ears of the animal were
certainly magnificent.

I must admit I was excited during the rest of that eventful evening. I
determined to keep the secret of my good fortune to myself. I thought
I would surprise the lady who does me the honour to bear my name, by
telling her that I had become a rich man after I had cashed the cheque
I was sure to receive. All the following day I made plans for the
spending of my fortune. I would have a box in the Highlands, a
_pied-à-terre_ in Paris, and a pyramid in Egypt. I would present
my Inn with a massive gold snuff-box, and PORTINGTON should have a
silver-mounted meerschaum. If my age did not bar my progress, I would
seek service in the Militia--as a lieutenant-colonel. There was no
limit to my ambition.

When I returned, Mr. WILKINS (who is thoroughly conscientious), having
finished the rebuilding of the pantry and the whitewashing of the
bath-room, had departed. He does not waste his time, and only charges
me for the hours he actually expends in honest labour. I hurried to
the spot where my Old BOOTS was temporarily resting before removal
to the far-famed auction-rooms in King Street, St. James's. I turned
pale.

"Why, what is this?" I asked, trembling with emotion.

"Your commission, dear," said my better seven-eighths. "It looks
better than the picture, although I must say the donkey improves on
acquaintance. It really was very well painted. I am quite sorry Mr.
WILKINS has taken it away."

"WILKINS taken it away?" I gasped out.

"Yes. He said that you didn't seem to care for it, so he went off to
try and sell it."

"Why!" I exclaimed, and my voice, through my deep emotion, dropped
almost to a whisper, "it is an Old BOOTS!"

"An Old BOOTS!" cried my better seven-eighths, becoming as excited as
myself. "Why, our fortunes are made! An Old BOOTS! Oh, why didn't you
tell me! An Old BOOTS! Fancy having an Old BOOTS!"

"But we haven't," I returned, almost in tears. "The handy-man has gone
off with it! What _are_ we to do without our Old BOOTS!"

"We will get it back!" returned my better and more important fraction,
with determination.

Whether we did recover our lost treasure, or fail in the attempt,
must, owing to the exigencies of space (so I am given to understand),
form the subject of another and concluding contribution. The chase
after our Old BOOTS was not without adventures of a distinctly
exciting character.

A SONG OF THE SNOWY SOUTH.

    ["'We were caught in a snowdrift' was Mr. GLADSTONE'S
    explanation. 'In Scotland they would have cleared it away in
    no time, but here they are not accustomed to deal with snow;'
    and, with upright bearing, and carrying a travelling rug which

    station with a springy gait."--_Central News Telegram from

  To our own G. O. M. 'twas the doctor who spoke;
  "You'd better get out of our frost, fog, and smoke.
  You are now eighty-five, though a wonder you be;
  So follow the sun, bonnie W. G.!
    Come flit from cold Hawarden, and fly off to Cannes,
    The sunny South calls you, our own Grand Old Man!
    Take the first _train de luxe_, and be off, fair and free,
    To RENDEL and roses, dear W. G.!"

  The G. O. M.'s off to the southward--to meet

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

It is noteworthy how in recent years, in the matter of fiction, the
star of Empire shineth in the North. After WALTER SCOTT established
the sovereignty of Scotland in the world of British fiction, there
was a long pause. In our generation WILLIAM BLACK came to the front.
Later, we have had STEVENSON, BARRIE, and CROCKETT. Now here is IAN
MACLAREN with his cluster of gem-like stories gathered _Beside the
Bonnie Briar Bush_ (HODDER AND STOUGHTON). My Baronite tells me
that of the collection Mr. GLADSTONE likes best "A Doctor of the Old
School." Where all is good it is difficult to establish supremacy.
But for simple pathos and for the skill of drawing with a few touches
living figures of flesh and blood, this sketch is certainly hard to
beat. Yet "A Lad of Pairts" runs it close. A very beautiful book, full
of human nature in its simplest form and most pathetic circumstances.

Says the Baron, "What I who have read Mr. BRAM STOKER'S latest romance
could tell you about _The Watter's Mou'_ would make your mou' watter
with longing desire to devour it. It is excellent: first because it is
short; secondly, because the excitement is kept up from first page
to last; and thirdly, because it is admirably written throughout; the
scenic descriptive portion being as entrancing as the dramatic. It is
brought out in the Acme Series in charge of A CONSTABLE, and its full
price is only one shilling."

A good short story is to be found in _A Clear Case of the
Supernatural_, by REGINALD LUCAS, only as it is by no means "a clear
case," it might have been appropriately entitled, _Fluke or Spook_.

  My brain it turns, though with ROB BURNS, I dearly love the
          lasses, O!

THAT WEDDING PRESENT.

_London._--JONES is going to be married. Of course, I must give him
something. But what? A biscuit box? Commonplace. Good idea to look for
something more interesting and unusual during my holiday. Just off to
North Italy. Will keep my eyes open along the way.

_Paris._--Walk in the Rue de la Paix and Boulevards. Everything
labelled "_Article Anglais_." Must really get him something made
abroad. Give up looking in Paris. Shall find something farther on.

_Lucerne._--No good to take Swiss wood carving. Can't carry home a
huge sideboard. All the smaller things can be bought in London.

_Milan._--The very place. There is an exhibition here. Shall probably
see something beautiful. Italy, cradle of the arts, and all that sort
of thing. Besides, so nice to say to JONES, "My dear fellow, here's
a little trifle; got it in Milan, you know. It's modern, but then
the Italians are always so artistic." To exhibition. Why, there are
pictures here! Of course, just suit me. Hurry to picture gallery.
Several rooms. Enter eagerly. After a short time, totter feebly out
and ask the official at the door where I can obtain a little brandy.
He, evidently alarmed by my horror-stricken face and staggering
movements, asks civilly if I am ill. Would I like a chair? Should he
fetch a doctor? Thank him, and say it is nothing serious. I have
only been looking at a few modern Italian pictures. Crawl to the
refreshment bar, and am revived with cognac. Then inspect the rest
of the exhibition. Am the only visitor, which is not surprising, for
there is nothing to see but bottles! An exhibition of bottles! They
are said to be full of wine, but I do not see how that makes them more
beautiful. Absurd to buy JONES some bottles. And equally absurd to
buy him some Italian wine when he can get good French wine in England.
Besides, can't carry bottles in my Gladstone bag. Therefore, give up
Milan.

_Venice._--The chief manufactures here are lace and glass. Now JONES
never wears any lace, except in his boots, and never wears any glass,
not even in his eye. So what good would these be to him? See one or
two palaces to be sold. But can't take them home. So give up Venice.

_Bologna._--More useless local productions! Here they make sausages
and soap. JONES is not a starving scarecrow for want of sausages, nor
a SIMEON STYLITES for want of soap. Must therefore give up Bologna.
This wedding present begins to weigh me down. At each new place it
obtrudes itself between me an all the beautiful things I look at. Must
really get something in Florence.

_Florence._--Great Scott! It's worse here. A life-size marble statue,
or a mosaic table weighing nearly a ton. Have serious thoughts
of buying, at a great reduction, an extra large statue, hitherto
unsaleable on account of its size, and then telling JONES that his
wedding present is waiting for him here, if he will come and fetch it.
The dealer asks 2,000 lire. I understand shopping in Italy. Early one
morning offer him 50. He at once comes down to 1,000. I go up to 100.
Discuss for one hour, haggle for another hour, dispute angrily for a
third. Then go off to _déjeuner_. Closing prices--dealer 725, myself
250. Back again after interval for refreshment. Begin quietly. Opening
prices--dealer 720, myself 251. Discussion, haggling, dispute as
before. Indignant marchings out by me, frantic pursuits by the
dealer. Final prices--dealer 403, myself 396. Each of us, hoarse and
exhausted, refuses to yield another centesimo. So do not buy statue
for JONES, and give up Florence. Genoa is the last chance.

_Genoa._--Velvet? What's the good of velvet to JONES? Besides it is
fabulously dear, something like attar of roses at so much a drop. Must
give up even Genoa.

_London._--Back again. Have bought a biscuit box and sent it to
JONES. Since then have met JONES'S cousin, and SMITH, and JONES'S
brother-in-law, and Mrs. ROBINSON, and a few other mutual friends. We
disagree in many things, but in one we seem to be unanimous. We have
all given him biscuit boxes!

    No mere ghost, as DICKENS said.

  All _his_ jolly books remind us
    Christmas is a glorious time.
  _Don't_ let bilious bogies blind us

THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.

X.--THE CHAIR.

As soon as we had agreed to allow the Parish Meeting Chairman to
preside, BLACK BOB jumped up and proposed that Mrs. LETHAM HAVITT
should be elected to the chair. She was a lady whose excellences he
need not dilate on. She had excellent business habits, and, with all
respect to Mrs. MARCH, she had as much right to a seat on the Council
as that lady. Then a miracle happened. Mrs. MARCH not only did not
resent this reference, but actually seconded Mrs. HAVITT. It was
essential, she said, that women should be represented as fully as
possible, and she should, without hesitation, embrace this opportunity
of securing a woman colleague. This made the situation serious, not to
say hopeless. After she had sat down, there was an ominous pause. At
length I rose and proposed myself. In impressive tones I pointed
put that the hand of the electors had pointed in no uncertain way to
myself, and that since no one else had proposed my election, at the
risk of being misunderstood _once more_, I had, on public grounds,
to do it myself. After another painful pause the Parson seconded my
nomination. Then the voting. Mrs. HAVITT'S name was put first. She
got 4 votes--Mrs. MARCH, BLACK BOB, and his two comrades. I got 3--the
Squire, the Parson, and my self. And so I was foiled again--by the
Eternal Feminine.

And so our Parish Council is at last complete, and ready for action, a
corporate body in the eyes of the law. Possibly, in these pages I may
from time to time be permitted to relate how Mudford progresses under
our rule. Possibly, I may not. But in any case I ought to add that,
being beaten by Mrs. HAVITT has not--well, improved the domestic
atmosphere. Wifely devotion seems to be out of fashion in these _fin
de siècle_ days.

VIVE LE TAILLEUR DU ROI.

    ["Le duc d'Orléans a voulu donner une leçon aux mauvais
    patriotes; il habite Londres, il charge un tailleur parisien
    du soin de garnir sa garde-robe."--_French Press._]

  Along the boulevard's busy curb
    That bristles bravely with _étrennes_,
  A thing has threatened to disturb
    The careless _vie parisienne;_
  It isn't spies or journalist blackmailers,
  It is the question of monarchic tailors.

  For lo! from _perfide Albion_
    Has lately come a ducal note
  With patterns for a _pantalon_
    And therewithal a _redingote;_
  (Observe, in passing, that the royal _billet_
  Says nothing of the corresponding _gilet_).

  Now while in matters of the gown
    The _monde_ of Paris sets the _mode_,
  Their gay _flâneurs_ that paint the town
    Long since affect a foreign code,
  Developing in fact a steady passion
  For dressing in the latest London fashion.

  With any perfect patriot
    How bitterly it stirs the bile,
  This craze for being clothed in what
    Is thought to be the English style;
  It makes the language of his heated brain
  Occasionally verge on the profane.

  And now the Exile, armed with red
    Hot coals of living anthracite,
  Projects them on his country's head,
    And more in pity than in spite
  Bids France that hunted him and his like rabbits
  Henceforth to execute his daily habits.

  Some fancy, romping at results,
    The constitution's overthrow,
  A view unworthy of adults,
    According to the _Figaro;_
  It makes a democrat extremely nettled.
  To hear the thing is practically settled.

  Of course there may be something in
    That strange omission of the vest,
  Yet were it little short of sin
    To lay this unction to the breast;
  A person isn't worth a paltry _filet_
  Who stakes the Third Republic on a _gilet_.

  There lacks, you see, a final law
    To guide in France the statesman's game
  The casual ignited straw
    Will set the camel's hump aflame;
  A _redingote_ may raise enough _éclat_
  To bring about a pretty _coup d'état_.

A CABINET SECRET.

(_Fragment for the Historian of the Future._)

    [After the Cabinet several of the Ministers present took
    luncheon with the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.--_Daily
    Paper._]

There had been an exciting meeting of the Members of the Ministry.
The gathering had taken place at noon, and after several angry
altercations it had been adjourned. But the objector-in-chief had
admirably kept his temper. He came of a gallant and illustrious race,
and blood is thicker than water.

"I must not forget the teachings of my Uncle DICK," he had murmured,
as it was suggested that two of his favourite projects should be
slaughtered, like the infant Princes in the Tower.

Then, when there was an inclination on the part of his colleagues to
quarrel amongst themselves, he cleverly fanned the fire, and increased
the incipient strife.

"It was the mode adopted by my maiden Aunt, QUEEN ELIZABETH, and
it succeeded in her time. Why should the passing of three or four
centuries make any difference? After all, human nature is--in
fact--human nature!"

And so the dull minutes passed away. The time came for luncheon. Then
he smiled a smile full of mystic hospitality.

"It will put the bloodhounds of the Press off the scent if I ask them
to luncheon with me. It is sure to be reported in the papers, and who
will imagine that I would willingly entertain a possible opponent to
the coming Budget? Moreover, revenge is sweet; not that I would take
it! not that I would take it!"

And then he entreated several of his colleagues to "crush a cup with
him," using a phraseology that had found favour in the mouths of the
Crusaders.

"And ROSEY, will not you come?" The question was asked with much
cordiality. The PREMIER did not reply. He merely smiled, and the smile
seemed to be a sufficient answer.

       * * *

Shortly afterwards (as subsequently reported in the newspapers) the
noble Earl took luncheon at his own home.

"I wonder what wine he has given _them?_" And he smiled again.

       *       *       *       *       *

"BOYS AND GIRLS COME OUT TO----PANTOMIME!"

_Santa Claus_, the afternoon pantomime at the Lyceum, is even better
than Mr. OSCAR BARRETT'S _Cinderella_ of last year. There is plenty
of splendour in the fairy piece, considered merely as a "spectacle,"
enough, indeed, to make a "pair of spectacles," and to cause much
speculation as to how they manage to stow away all the scenery,
properties, and costumes at five o'clock every afternoon, in order
to make room for _King Arthur_, who, on the temporary abdication of
_Santa Claus_ (a part admirably acted and declaimed by Mr. WILLIAM
RIGNOLD), reigns at the Lyceum from eight till eleven. But besides the
dazzling brilliancy of fairy pantomime, there is in it not only real
fun which delights the youngsters, for whom the entertainment is
primarily intended, but also a touch of dramatic pathos, as shown
in the death of the devoted dog _Tatters_, a dog who has his day and
dies, whose cruel fate excites the compassion of old and young alike.
All are rejoiced when they find out that clever Mr. CHARLES LAURI, of
whom it can be complimentarily said that "he is a perfect beast," is
restored to life, and that the Heavenly Twins are happily revived.

[Illustration]

As the two toy soldiers Messrs. HARRY and FRED KITCHEN--the front
and back kitchen--are first-rate. But where all are so good it is
impossible, within the limits of a paragraph, to particularise. Messrs
BARRETT and LENNARD are to be congratulated, and, as _Hamlet_ says,
"The Pantomime's the thing," and, as Shakspearian readers will
remember, _Hamlet's_ father went to _matinées_,--wasn't it "his custom
always of an afternoon"?--only there's no sleeping here, but everyone
very wide awake, and all "going home to tea" thoroughly satisfied with
_Santa Claus_. Who says _Le Roi Pantomime est mort_, when the Lyceum
is crowded for _matinées_, and, outside the doors of Old Drury, daily
and nightly appear the placards, "House Full"?

professional blackmailer?

_Someone Else._ But surely the same sort of thing has been done by
SARDOU in _Dora?_

_Charles his Friend._ Why not? A dramatist has only one virtue, he
never invents a drama.

_A Casual Visitor._ Then we have only to regard the Adelphi as a
model, and take the Wyldest license with the dialogue.

_Charles his Friend._ Quite so. After all, a paradox is merely a
platitude.

_A Caller._ But do great men do these things?

_Charles his Friend._ The great do all things because they are little.

_A Lady._ Surely a wife should look up to her husband?

_Charles his Friend._ So she does--unless she wears high heels.

_A Person._ And a wife, if she found her husband in trouble, would
surely cleave to him?

_Charles his Friend._ So she would, if she only knew where to find

people invariably are when vice is at a discount and virtue at a
premium.

_Charles his Friend._ Virtue never is at a premium, save when it is
mistaken for vice.

_A blasé Man of the World._ And yet, in spite of all this, I have had
a pleasant evening.

_Charles his Friend._ So has an author when he is laughing in his
sleeve and confuses black with white.

_Someone._ But does the author never know the difference?

_Charles his Friend._ What does it matter? If he thinks himself right,
everybody will know that he is wrong!

_The Audience._ All this is very clever because it is unintelligible.

_The Author._ So I believe. Only I stand upon my irresponsibility. But
is anyone satisfied with anything in a playhouse?

_Charles his Friend._ Only with the fall of the curtain!

    [_Scene closes in upon nothing in particular._

THE REAL NEW WOMAN.

  I own there are heights that she cannot attain.
    She is not at home with a gun.
  In pastimes where one living creature is slain
    She cannot perceive any fun;
  And never a poor feathered songster has died
    Her hat or her bonnet to grace;
  And after the hounds it were torture to ride,
    Lest Reynard should lose in the race.

  And much she ignores that New Women should learn,
    And still she refuses to smoke:
  One wine from another she cannot discern,
    But she's splendid at seeing a joke.
  Her love and her friendship no labour can fret,
    No jealousy seems to alarm.
  In truth, not a mortal could ever forget
    Her humour, her kindness, her charm.

  Though dozens of friends of her fealty boast,
    Her desk with epistles is packed,
  Her very own relatives love her the most--
    A somewhat remarkable fact!
  With bores and with fools she ungrudgingly bears,
    And though it may end in her loss,
  With cabmen she never can wrangle for fares,
    Or haggle a counter across.

  Her eyes, that are loyal and fearless and kind,
    At wrong or injustice will flame,
  But they never seem anxious a failure to find,
    They never are hasty to blame;
  And well she is loved by the best and the worst,
    For sympathy, courage, and truth,
  For friendship unfailing they love her, the first;
    The last, for her infinite ruth.

  Oh, what if she never should do or should dare
    In regions by Woman untrod?
  Yet, when her step passes, men turn from despair,
    And trust in the world and in God.
  Oh, what if no "record" she cares to eclipse,
    Nor manners nor morals defies?
  But pain she would face with a smile on her lips,
    And death with a light in her eyes!

"THE GHIZEH MUSEUM."--A question has been asked in the _Times_ as to
why the name of Professor PETRIE has been omitted from the Commission
for the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities. The answer, whether
satisfactory or not, is that considering the overwhelming learning
on this special subject of the distinguished Professor it is probable
that the energies of the other members would be "Petrie-fied."

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
