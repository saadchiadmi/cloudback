HOW SHE FELT IN HER FIRST CORSET
AND OTHER POEMS.

BY
MATT. W. ALDERSON.

     Let all thy actions have a motive true;
     Inwardly feel and love whate'er you do;
     Naught but wrong acts e'er cause the blush of shame,
     And, right yourself, then scorn another's blame.

HOW SHE FELT IN HER FIRST CORSET.


     It occurred at Belgrade, where the genial Tom Quaw,
     Gave a party, the first that the town ever saw;
     The youth and the beauty, the tillers of soil,
     Attended that night, seeking surcease from toil.

     There were farmers whose hair had a tinge of the gray;
     There were maidens than whom none were ever more gay;
     There were youths who could ride anything that wears hair,
     And matrons whose faces showed lines of dull care.

     Of the ladies who on this occasion took part,
     Some were dressed in the nobbiest style of the art;
     And the others, unmindful of fashion's decrees,
     Were attired to have much more comfort and ease.

     There was one blushing damsel, just budding sixteen,
     Whose waist by a corset ne'er encircled had been,
     But whose mother insisted that on such a night
     One should find a place there, and the lacing be tight.

     So the girl was rigged out as the mother desired,
     But of dancing 'twas noticed the damsel soon tired.
     "What's the matter?" was asked by some one at her side.
     "I feel just like bucking," the maiden replied.




A LOVER'S VALENTINE.


         Sweetheart of mine,
         A valentine,
     In duty bound, I send thee,
         And wish that joy,
         Free from alloy,
     May evermore attend thee.

         Near, or apart,
         Still may thy heart
     To mine in friendship nestle;
         For strong and free,
         In love for thee,
     'Gainst countless foes I'd wrestle.

         Since I am thine,
         Pray do be mine,
     My heart prompts me to ask thee;
         Thy charming face,
         And matchless grace,
     I own have quite possessed me.




TO THOSE WHO HOLD THE GUIDING REINS.


     I have observed a steed, proud-spirited,
     Lashed by a cruel driver till the sweat
     Stood out in beaded drops upon his side;
     And, oftimes, tears have welled up in my eyes
     As in my mind I've pictured human hearts
     Lashed thus by cruel words and goaded on.
     Then when, at other times, the same proud steed
     Has passed along the street with arched neck,
     With every motion breathing force and vim,
     I've noticed kindness held the guiding reins
     And kept in check the zealous prancer's power.
     My mind has pictured then, with kindlier glow,
     A heart ambitious, far too keen to go,
     Kept by sweet loving words in proper bounds;
     And deepest gratitude, at such a time,
     Wells up for those who hold the guiding reins.




HIS FACE IS HIS FORTUNE.


     "His face is his fortune;"
         Yes, seldom we see
     One for "tick" importune,
         As boldly as he.

     Like one who has riches
         Acquired by gift,
     He laughs at the stitches
         Of gainer by thrift,

     For face is his treasure,
         And why keep in bank?
     One cannot find pleasure
         With pocket-book lank.

     So credit he uses
         Where'er it will pass,
     And always abuses
         The laboring class.

     But "cheek" is like iron
         That's coated with tin,
     It has a nice face on,
         But one rather thin.




A LOVE LETTER AND ITS ANSWER.


A MONTANIAN TO HIS SWEETHEART.


     Darling, I love thee! Other words might tell
     A trifle of how dear thou art to me,
     But these tell all. Of thee I might have said,
     And said in truth, at that, that all thy ways,
     Thine every motion, look and glance, as well,
     Did charm the inmost recess of my soul:
     In words of praise, and those in justice due,
     I might the beauties of thy mind portray;
     For they outrival charms that in thy face
     I see, as elsewhere I have failed to find:
     Thy modesty, thy grace, thy love of all
     That tends to elevate, to purify,
     And make a fellow mortal happier,
     I might have dwelt on to a length that thou,
     And thou alone, deserves from one whose pen
     Is feeble in thy praise as is mine own.
     Still, had I done so, and withheld the words,
     "I love thee!" I had never told thee half.
     I love thee, darling! Ah! indeed, I do!
     Beyond the shadow of a doubt, I love,
     And such a one as any prince or king
     Might gladly love and proudly call his own.
     But, come to think, this love is all I have:
     No titled rank is mine--no Astor's wealth;
     And one you know, can't live on love alone;
     Ah, no! But better starve for lack of bread
     Than want of love; for when we starve for bread,
     And hunger knaws with all its well-known force,
     A day and all desire for food grows weak,
     And in its stead one craves but rest and sleep:
     These come, and few the days ere dreamless sleep
     Supplies the place of all desires and pains.
     But, starve for love, and when doth come relief?
     The weary soul still lives, or drags along--
     As pris'ner doomed for life goes to his work;
     Ambitionless it moves, its purpose dead,
     Yet ling'ring like 'twere powerless to go;
     Struggling 'twixt hope and fear, as thro' the bars
     A gleam of sunshine flitters now and then,
     Glad'ning the while it shines, to leave more dark
     The gloomy dungeon of an unloved life;
     Moving, as moves the lifeless rock or ore
     When those with life exert o'er it their power;
     Living! Ah, yes! But devil never cursed
     His vilest victim with a death so dread;
     Standing, as stands an engine on the track,
     Perfectly built in all its mighty parts,
     Its boiler and its furnace amply fed,
     Yet powerless. But, let the flame of love
     Touch but one splinter of the waiting pyre,
     And all is changed. In gladsome bounds the blaze
     Leaps on and on, till burning with one flame,
     The fire warms the slumb'ring soul to life;
     Warms till, as love directs, its living proves--
     When under wisdom's hands--man's highest bliss.
     Yes, when love fills the heart, behold how strong,
     How powerful one stands! His muscles ache
     With pure strength, and long for that on which
     Their latent power to show; and not alone
     In idle longings doth a lover stand,
     But works alike with both his head and hands
     To gain desired ends. Doth one lack means?
     Then love supplies a purpose and desire,
     And rests not still till they are at command.
     Doth one feel weak? Then love doth make him strong.
     Is one a slave to appetite or care?
     Then love doth free him from the galling chains.
     Doth one lack knowledge or attainments rare?
     Then love spurs on till all of these are gained.
     Yes love, and that alone, is all I have;
     But, darling, having that, I offer thee
     More than all else another man can give,
     Who hath abundance, and is rich in all
     Save love, and that for thee, and thee alone.
     This is my plea. I stand and wait my fate.
     If thou dost love me, darling, tell me so;
     If not--but that can never be, I know.


THE ANSWER SHE GAVE HIM.


     Your note to me, of recent date,
     Where you are so importunate,
     Has been received, and I have read,
     With greatest care, what you have said.
     I am quite pleased that you can see
     So much to praise in one like me,
     And only wish that I could say
     Nice things in such a pretty way.
     But, tell me! do you really think
     That love is better than "the chink?"
     Why, money rules the world to-day,
     With strong and unresistless sway!
     'Tis little schoolboys talk of love.
     But as they older grow, improve;
     While girls, though they be very young,
     Know better but may hold their tongue.
     If you have money, then you can
     Go where you will, and be a man;
     But if you're poor--a genius, too--
     Your family can be but blue,
     While oft you'll wish for food to eat,
     And for firm friends your heart to greet.
     You own you're poor, yet ask of me
     To share a poor man's misery!
     Why men would be real scarce indeed,
     Ere I should think to feel the need
     Of one who nothing has but love!
     Poor men abound where'er we rove,
     And I can get one any day:
     (When rich, pray call around this way).
     Suppose we loved, and married were,
     And fortune gave to us an heir,
     Pray who would nurse and care for it?
     Who train its mind? who mould its wit?
     Who'd wash the dishes, cook the food,
     Do out-door chores, and cut the wood?
     What buggy rides would I receive?
     How many friends would to me cleave?
     And then there's concerts to attend,
     And other places, that transcend
     The theaters and balls that now
     We with unstinted praise endow.
     Oh, no! don't ask of me to wed
     A loving fellow, though his head
     Be better filled with brains than those
     Who dress themselves in finer clothes:
     I want a man who's rich in stocks--
     (D'ye think I'd ever darn old socks?)
     You talk of love and lovers bold,
     As though I'd care if icy cold
     Were heart of him to whom with pride
     My loving heart I'd fondly tied.
     I would be rich and nothing care,
     For I'd have lover's everywhere;
     And when of one I tired grew,
     I'd take my pick and love anew.
     Now don't be angry with me, pray,
     For what I've written you to-day;
     You were to me so frank and true
     I could not well be less to you;
     So I have said what all must feel,
     Though some, I know, the facts conceal.
     Then do not seek just now to wed,
     But wait until you're rich, instead.




THE BABY'S CLOTHES.


     Let poets praise, as in days gone by,
     The wealth of a loving maiden's sigh;
     The bliss ecstatic of every bride,
     And honeymoon pleasures that ne'er subside;
     I sing of a happier time than those,
     The time when making the baby's clothes.

     A girlish heart may o'erflow with joy
     When with the one she would call "her boy,"
     And a doting wife may fail to cloy
     A heart kept free from every alloy;
     But joys surpassing the sweetest of those
     Come when preparing the baby's clothes.




A SISTER'S LOVE.


     They say that the angels look down from above
         And watch us wherever we stray;
     That they are the beings that guide us in love
         And bring us the joys of the day.

     I am glad it is so, and thank them to-night
         For the wealth of a sister's love,
     For of all the pleasures they bring to as here
         That's nearest the joys above.

     I've felt so real often as in my arms
         I've clasped her form and kissed her;
     But the girl that I kissed was not my own,
         She was another fellow's sister.




A SCHOOL-MA'AM'S STORY.


     I was a teacher then, as now,
         And made a little spending money.
     By training big and little sprouts,
         In a mining town called Pony.

     One night the biggest boy I had,
         For having cracked a rigid rule,
     Was bade to stay and con his books
         Some fifteen minutes after school.

     I for a moment turned my back--
         On other duties then intent--
     The fellow slyly raised a sash
         And through the opening quickly went.

     Next eve, as extra punishment,
         I gave him minutes forty-five;
     And, lest he play the prank again,
         I kept my every sense alive.

     The task performed, he left the room;--
         The sun was shining then, no more,--
     And when, soon afterwards, I left,
         I found him waiting at the door.

     "'Tis getting late," the youth remarked,
        "For ladies to be out alone,
     And, may I have the pleasure, Miss,
         Of seeing that you're safely home?"

     I smiled and took the gallant's arm,
         What else could anybody do?
     I've liked the fellow ever since
         And have no doubt he likes me too.




TRUE LOVE.


     Ask of the winds, that all around
         In saddest requiem blow,
     Wherein, and where alone, is found
         True happiness below;
     And when "in love" their answer is,
         Would you love's secret know?
     Consider both have equal rights,
         And treat each other so.

     Thus sang a poet months ago,
         As o'er the world he roamed
     And saw the home of dearest friends,
         To desolation doomed;
     A home where, years before, the bride
         With heart of joy and glee,
     Had welcomed to her heart's embrace
         A bud of misery.

     "A bud of misery," you say?
         Yes, thinking it a rose,
     And little dreaming that its folds
         No fragrance did enclose:
     But so the after years have shown,
         And blighted hearts are found
     Where once affection reigned supreme,
         And spread its joys around.

     He loved her, but he never thought
         That love should be expressed,
     And slights that caused her keenest pain,
         He never once redressed;
     To me he often wished he'd been
         To her a better man;
     But urged to tell his wife as much,
         He would not brook the plan.

     Oh, ye! on whom some heart depends,
         For all its store of bliss,
     Withhold not from that tender soul
         The loving word and kiss;
     But, give expression to your love,
         And make its bliss complete,
     By giving those within your home
         Unfettered love to greet.




WE'VE GROWN APART IN ALL THESE YEARS.


     We were firm friends in years gone by,
         Were classmates at the school,
     And kept each other company,
         Against the master's rule.

     For he was righteous and he taught:
        "No boys with girls shall play!"
     I wonder if he really thought
         They'd lead us all astray.

     "No messages shall pass between
         The scholars in this school!
     And, woe to him who first is seen
         To violate this rule!"

     By fear and awe were all oppressed
         And knew not what to do:
     But I, more bold than all the rest,
         Sent Kate my billets-doux.

     She answered them, and sweeter notes
         A lover never read;
     I've often wondered since that time
         They never turned my head.

     And when our daily tasks were o'er,
         Away from school we ran
     To meet within some leafy dell
         And both our futures plan.

     But now she meets me with reserve,
         No welcome, as of yore;
     No parting with a warm embrace,
         No kisses at the door.

     Another fellow charms her now;
         She's children pert and tripper
     And, many a time, upon her knee,
         She spanks them with her slipper.




POLITICAL ECONOMY.


CHAPTER I--PRODUCTION.


     A youth, not handsome from an outward view,
     Whose features stern belied the mellowness
     That dwelt behind his earnest, steadfast look,
     Delved in his heart upon a summer day
     And found therein a narrow vein of love.
     The prospect pleased, and on development
     He found the mine was rich. For years he worked
     And piled in heaps the ore upon the dump.
     Deep 'neath the mountain ridges of his heart
     He branched out levels on the silvered streak,
     And found almost exhaustless hidden wealth.
     He sought association, and he found
     A friend who brought the skill to treat the ore.
     He wasted not the wealth by labor won,
     But, when refined, he stored the bricks away,
     Until within himself there was no space,
     And he was but a treasure house of love.


CHAPTER II--EXCHANGE.


     The youth is lost. Behold, on manhood's verge,
     Our hero now. A market for his ware
     He seeks at home in vain. There smallest coins
     Supply the daily needs, and he must seek
     A distant shore, and one to coin his wealth.
     Undauntedly, despite unbroken paths,
     Unheeding storms and floods, he presses on
     To reach her side. An aged man stands guard,
     And yet he marches up the walks unchecked.
     His very boldness awes. A maiden there
     Is pleased with what he brings, and from her heart
     She gladly pays him golden coin therefor.
     She mints her boughten wealth, and later on
     They meet again. They ride the garden gate.
     Proximity, free trade promote exchange.
     She pays him back his own, each coin a kiss.
     The market steady rules, demand is strong.
     Supply exhaustless. 'Tis called a fair exchange,
     And yet they both are richer made thereby.


CHAPTER III--CONSUMPTION.


     Beneath her father's roof we see them next,
     And at the altar plight their faith--each heart
     By love firm bound, and yet by love left free.
     The years roll by and for the staff of life
     They live on love. They need conveniences,
     And love provides them all. Their luxuries
     Are daily feasts of love. There are some days
     When, overcome by care and household toils,
     Her heart is faint, but when she seeks his side
     She meets love's sweet caress and cheering kiss,
     And wonders that her spirits ever drooped.
     He never leaves her side but with a kiss,
     And, when they meet again, he clasps her form
     And plants love's token on her waiting lips.
     Would'st thou the secret know, of happy homes?
     'Tis gallantries like these that make them so.
     At times when prostrate on her bed she lays,
     She makes sad inroads on his stock of wealth;
     Still, freely, lavishly he gives it her,
     And wooes her back to health again, thro' love.
     About the hearth a troop of children comes,
     And as he soothes and cheers their restless hearts,
     His garnered wealth, like snow, fast melts away.
     The mine can be depended on no more;
     Old age creeps on apace, and in his heart
     He feels the strained timbers giving 'way.
     He feeds now on the wealth in other days
     Invested where 'twould bring a safe return.
     With tottering steps yet proud he walks the streets,
     And still has smiles for everyone he meets.


CHAPTER IV--DISTRIBUTION.


     Upon his bed with withered, palsied frame,
     Behold an aged man! A life well spent
     Is drawing to a close. About him stand
     The loved ones of his home. They prop him up
     As with a halting voice, yet clear, he speaks:
     "My treasured store of love will soon be yours.
     Waste not the capital I leave behind
     In shedding bitter tears above my grave;
     I shall not feel thy love, and if I should,
     'Twould make me sad to see you weeping there;
     As thou dost love me, seek and cheer the hearts
     That find life's road a sad and lonesome way;
     My dying wish, yes children, my command,
     Is that you love--yes, love--each oth--er here."
     He breathes no more.
                          The last sad rites performed,
     The hearts bereaved return with saddened step
     And enters once again upon life's tasks.
     The father's dying wish rings in their ears;
     They check the flow of tears and rise above
     The grief that bends them low. Love flows again,
     And on the gates the youths and maidens fair
     Are gaily swinging back and forth once more,
     Fresh coinage from the mint is passing now,
     And, as we walk the streets, upon the air
     There rings a sound that proves the metal true.

practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
