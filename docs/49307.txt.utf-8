To the Prospective Student


If you are about to make your start in life, or not satisfied with your
present line of work, or for the sake of your health are desirous of
securing a change of employment which will take you out into the open
air, it is worth your while to consider the matter of learning to be an
expert automobile operator and to take up that line of work.

The great growth and development of the automobile and its use needs no
comment. The compensation of the chauffeur is good and the demand for
his services so steady, and the standing of the profession is so high
now, that it is more and more attractive to that class of individuals
who are able and willing to combine mechanical skill with intellectual
effort.

It is for that class of men this course is intended and it is that
class of men, who, by supplementing their natural mechanical genius
with a little properly directed mental work, can qualify themselves to
secure well paid positions, such as, to the proper persons, are certain
to prove stepping stones to greater advancement.

The great number of chauffeurs who enjoy the esteem and confidence of
their wealthy employers is well known, and we could enumerate hundreds
who have started in business for themselves and who are on the road to
wealth through the assistance of their employer.




The Object of Our School


The object of our School is to prepare young men throughout the country
to become expert chauffeurs, repairmen, demonstrators, salesmen, garage
managers, etc.

Our president, Mr. C. A. Coey, has been in the automobile business for
twelve years, and he is one of the most prominent automobile men in
America today.

During this time he has sold thousands of automobiles, and his
customers can be found in every state in the Union. He found that the
only way he could supply the demands of the automobile dealers and
manufacturers throughout the country, was to open a school of motoring,
and it is for this reason that _C. A. COEY'S SCHOOL OF MOTORING_ was
started.

Mr. Coey commenced as a small farmer boy himself, and he knows that
the country boys are even more ambitious than those in the city, but
they do not have the opportunities like the city boys. And because he
knew that there were plenty of such young men all over the country,
who would be able to fill just such positions, if they could but
prepare themselves, and at the same time to supply the demand from his
customers throughout the country for good honest young men he founded
this School.

A Word About our President

Mr. C. A. Coey


Mr. Coey has been prominently identified with the automobile business
in Chicago from its inception, in fact, he is the pioneer automobile
man of Chicago.

He constructed the first building ever erected in America for an
automobile garage, which is now standing at the corner of Cottage Grove
Avenue and 53rd St., Chicago, Illinois.

[Illustration: The first building erected for an Automobile
Garage--built by C. A. Coey.]

He placed the first taxicabs on the streets of Chicago and now owns the
best in the city.

[Illustration: The first taxicab seen in Chicago--C. A. Coey, owner.]

He is one of the few who made a success of the automobile livery
business, beginning with one car and increasing to fifty. Commencing
with practically nothing, he built up not only the largest automobile
livery business in the country, but also the largest automobile sales
business in America. The companies bearing his name now maintain a
large garage and salesroom.

Mr. Coey is intimately connected with some of the foremost men of this
country and is well known as an automobile manufacturer and dealer
throughout the country, and a _DIPLOMA_ with his name signed to it is
the best thing you can have when looking for any kind of employment in
the automobile industry.

He has secured more good paying positions for his students and friends
than all other auto schools in America combined, because he is so well
known.

Mr. Coey has won more twenty-four hour races than any other man living
and holds the world's record for twenty-four hours for a one-man
driver, covering 990 miles without a minute's rest.

Mr. Coey has also been widely known throughout the country in
connection with ballooning, and he holds the world's speed record,
having covered six hundred and seven miles in ten hours and fifty-five
minutes, ascending at Quincy, Illinois, on the 2nd day of June, 1907,
in the evening and sailing through the clouds all night, through
thunder storms, and making a landing at Clear Lake, South Dakota, at
five A. M. the next day.

[Illustration: The landing he made in a tree top in Illinois.]

On the flight from Chicago on the 4th of July, 1908, at the meeting of
the Aeronautique Club of Chicago, of which Mr. Coey was president, he
crossed the Great Lake, landing in West Monkton, Canada, covering a
distance of five hundred and fifty-six miles, having made the flight in
a single night in his balloon, "Chicago," the largest balloon in the
World. In this trip he sailed over seventy-five miles of water.

Our Correspondence Course


For the benefit of those who cannot spare the time to come to our
School, we have compiled a correspondence course, in which we will
guarantee to teach you how to run, repair and demonstrate any
automobile _in ten weeks_.

This course consists of ten lessons all written plainly and in such an
intelligent manner, that anyone who can read and write can master any
automobile.

They lead you step by step, on and on until you have reached the end,
and then you will be surprised at your own knowledge of an automobile.

We send you one lesson at a time, and as soon as you have answered all
of the questions contained on the last page of the book correctly, we
will send you the next lesson, and so on, until you have received the
ten lessons. Some can master two and three a week--it all depends upon
the person.

We assist backward students by giving more time to them and answering
any questions they wish to ask, as we desire above everything else to
make every student a first class high grade automobile man, an honor to
our School and a help to us and our customers.

The cost of our correspondence course is $15.00. If, after you have
finished our correspondence course, you wish to learn the manufacture
of a motor car, you can come to our factory, and we will give you our
practical course at our regular rates and deduct the amount you have
paid for the correspondence course.

Many who have decided to come to our factory and take our practical
course wait until they have finished the correspondence course, where
in the quiet of their homes they can get the principles fixed in
their minds, and then when they come to our School they are ready for
business.

Ten Weeks Sufficient


There is no reason why one cannot finish our course in the allotted
time of ten weeks, but no charge will be made if more time is required,
as we desire above everything to give you such a course that your
efficiency will make your work a pleasure.

Your work can be done as well thousands of miles away as if you were on
the ground at our School.

If you contemplate purchasing a machine, you could not do better than
to first take our course, when you will be able to judge better on your
own account precisely what style of machine is peculiarly adapted to
your needs and your particular section of the country.

We can be of great service to you in choosing a machine. Some machines
are better adapted to certain localities than others; for instance,
a hilly or sandy country requires a low geared, light weight, high
powered machine, and you can rest assured on getting our unbiased
opinion.

Our course has been taken by many ladies who own or contemplate owning
a machine, and they are among those who are most emphatic in praising
our method of teaching.

[Illustration: Scene of a bull fight taken by C. A. Coey.]




Remember


It is a nice thing to understand a motor, whether you ever intend to
drive one or not.

                           *       *       *

No one should purchase an automobile without first taking our course.

                           *       *       *

The man who buys a motor car without first learning one will live to
regret the day.

                           *       *       *

Astonishing, but nevertheless true, not one-half of the machines
manufactured are fit to be placed on the market. Do you know the reason
why?

                           *       *       *

Never buy a car with the weak point, every other car has it, take our
course and be able to select the right one.

                           *       *       *

Motoring is easy and pleasant, if you are its master, but if you are
not, you had better stay at home.

                           *       *       *

Whether you spend most of your time under the car or on the car,
depends on whether or not you understand it.

                           *       *       *

A thousand things can happen to a motor, any one of which is easily
remedied if you know where to begin.

                           *       *       *

A Diploma is valuable when backed by one who is prominent in the
automobile world, and with a _COEY DIPLOMA_ at your back, you are
independent for life.




Our Practical Course


There is, perhaps, no place in this wide world where the student can
get such thorough training as at our factory. We are the only ones
in this country who have a factory where up-to-date automobiles are
actually built by students.

[Illustration: A few of our students getting actual experience.]

[Illustration: Each student works alone--showing the separate
apartments.]

The average practical automobile school, and we might say every last
one of them, instruct their students on old, worn-out, out-of-date
machines, which are ready for the junk pile, and what they learn on
those old relics will do them no good, in fact, they might better have
taken no schooling at all, as such work only tends to confuse and
mislead them. For if a person once learns to do a thing the wrong way,
he usually keeps on doing it and it is hard to get out of the habit.
And that is the reason why our students have been successful in filling
fine, easy, and well paying positions, because they are instructed on
up-to-date machines in an up-to-date manner.

[Illustration: A view of our lecture room.]

[Illustration: A corner in our machine shop.]

In our factory we teach a student the art of automobile building, and
teach him to drive the machine he himself has helped to build.

[Illustration: A few of our students out driving in a car they helped
to build.]

He takes it from the ground up, under the very best trained and skilled
mechanics and instructors in America, and when he has finished he can
command big wages.

[Illustration: One of our cars which students are instructed to
operate.]

It requires from three to eight weeks to go through our factory, all
depending on the aptness of the student. We try to get our students
through as quickly as possible, but we will not issue a Diploma until
in our estimation he is qualified to fill any position in connection
with an automobile.

[Illustration: A Chauffeur's picnic with C. A. Coey's colored mascot in
the foreground.]

Since you have decided to take up the automobile business, the question
naturally arises, "Where can I learn it the best? and after I have
learned it, which school is in better shape to help me to get a good
paying position?"

Any school will tell you they will assist you, but what does that mean?
It means simply nothing at all because there is nothing behind it.
Assistance will do you no good unless you get the position.

The President of the United States could give you any kind of a
position you could ask for, because he has the influence, so could
the Governor of your state--influence is what counts. You stand a
far better chance of getting a good paying position through our
School--yes, ten to one, better than in any other school in the world.

Anyone with ordinary intelligence can write a book on automobile
instruction--anyone can run an advertisement in the paper and get
replies, and send out glowing literature, and get letters from
prominent automobile men and dealers and manufacturers, but when it
comes to getting you a position that is where they are weak.

[Illustration: A view of Mr. Coey's automobile salesroom, where
students get actual experience selling new cars.]

[Illustration: C. A. Coey in his private office, the finest on
"Automobile Row."]

We could name one auto school owner in the middle West and one in the
East, who were never in the automobile business, and who do not even
now own one. They send out glowing advertisements and secure letters
from auto manufacturers and dealers to help them get started, but if
you can find where a single person has ever secured a position through
these letters or through their influence, excepting a few whom they
have paid themselves in order to get some recommendations, we will send
you our course free.

Do you know that Mr. Coey is the only one of any importance in the
automobile world whatsoever who is connected with an automobile
school? Do you know that he is the only one who is engaged in handling
high grade motor cars? And last but not least, not another person in
the world running an automobile school has any connection with an
automobile factory. So what does it mean?

Just this--that instead of a few ex-chauffeurs or ex-clerks banding
together and calling themselves an auto school, we have as our head
a _real automobile man_, one with vast interests and prominently
connected in many branches of the business, and one who can secure you
a position.

Send your application in today and commence at once.

  Yours for success,

  C. A. COEY'S SCHOOL OF MOTORING,
  1424-26 Michigan Avenue.      CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, U. S. A.




Our Diploma


There is no better recommendation for anyone than a Diploma from _C. A.
COEY'S SCHOOL OF MOTORING_, which stands the country over for _SUCCESS_.

It is one thing to learn the automobile business, but quite another to
get profitable employment. Forty diplomas will not help you unless the
School is backed by someone well-known in the automobile world.

It is not our policy to get your money and then rush you through. We
are interested in you from the time you start until long after you have
finished. We cannot conduct our business throughout the country without
_you_, so _we must train you right_.

The thousands of automobiles which Mr. Coey sold during the past ten
years all need drivers, and our customers and agents in every territory
look to us to keep them supplied.

[Illustration: This is the thing that will insure you a job at any time
and at any place.]




Employment Department


This department is maintained for the exclusive use of our students
_free of charge_. We supply first class help for positions as:

  Chauffeurs,

  Racers,

  Auto Salesmen,

  Demonstrators,

  Garage Managers,

  Assemblers for factories,

  And all branches of the automobile business.

[Illustration: One of Mr. Coey's drivers on one of his taxicabs, who
made $105.55 in one week.]




Terms of Tuition


While our course is the most complete and thorough, yet our rates
have been kept as low as possible. As we figure we might better have
students in all walks of life, we have placed the price within reach of
all. It is, however, subject to a raise without notice.

(For rates see our Application Blank)




City Examinations


After you have spent your time in an Auto School then comes the city
examination, which, if you do not pass, you might as well not have
wasted your time. Do you know that over one-half who, after they have
secured their diploma, are not able to pass the examinations for a City
License? Well, it is true. _But not a single one of OUR students has
ever failed to pass the examinations and secure a chauffeur's license._

The City Mechanician of Chicago, Mr. H. L. Hudson, who decides whether
or not you are entitled to a license, commenced with Mr. Coey in the
automobile business in 1900. He was Mr. Coey's private mechanician on
his racing cars. Mr. Hudson is an automobile expert and that is the
reason he holds a fine city position. He recently inspected our School,
and this is what he said:

 "I wish to compliment you on the method you employ in your School of
 Motoring. The many years I spent as mechanician on your private racing
 cars certainly furnished us both information of a definite character,
 which is necessary for a man holding such an important position as
 Automobile School Instructor and Examiner of the Board of Public Motor
 Vehicle Register of the City of Chicago.

 You seem to have the proper system and your vast experience with
 chauffeurs in the ten years past fits you, as no one else is fitted,
 for a competent instructor. I believe you are on the right track and
 wish you success.

  Yours very truly,
  (Signed) H. L. HUDSON,
  City Mechanician."

The following is what the Chicago Examiner has to say about our School.
(This article appeared without our knowledge and shows our standing in
the City of Chicago, which assures you of a square deal.)

 "SCHOOL IS OPENED TO INSTRUCT AUTO DRIVERS."

 "A motoring school for the purpose of instructing persons in the
 running of automobiles has just been opened by C. A. Coey. This school
 will be of national scope and owing to the fact that Chicago is
 centrally located and the great railroad and mail distributing center,
 it will enable persons desirous of availing themselves of the benefits
 of institutions of this sort, to be in direct communication with
 instructors. Mr. Coey is nationally recognized as one of America's
 pioneer motorists and he realizes, as do the manufacturers, that the
 failure of so many automobiles to perform their proper functions
 and the occurrence of so great a number of accidents are due to the
 inefficiency of persons handling them."

A clipping from the Chicago Journal reads as follows:

 "Charles A. Coey is one of the pioneer automobile men of Chicago. He
 entered the business in 1900 and conducted a motor livery until 1902,
 when he became Chicago agent for the Thomas Flyer. He handled the
 Thomas line from 1902 until 1909, when he gave up the selling end to
 devote all his attention to his taxicab business. Last year he became
 Chicago agent for the American car, which he is handling under a
 ten-year contract. He is president of a company which is manufacturing
 the Coey Flyer in Chicago. Mr. Coey is well-known as an automobile
 racing driver and aeronaut. He won the Chicago Automobile Club's
 twenty-four-hour race at Harlem several years ago. He has made many
 long-distance flights in balloons."

And the Live Stock Magazine has this to say:

 "Perhaps the oldest and most prominent person in the automobile
 business in Chicago is C. A. Coey, the pioneer automobile dealer.
 Mr. Coey started an automobile school in 1901 at 5311 Cottage Grove
 Ave., Chicago, and it was there that the first building ever erected
 for an Automobile Livery was built. While Mr. Coey did not at that
 time advertise his School of Motoring, yet he started on an extensive
 business in this line, and it was said that over one thousand are
 now holding good, steady, well-paying jobs, and drawing salaries up
 to $75 a week. Mr. Coey's system is different from the rest, as he
 believes that a student can learn the foundation principles in the
 quiet of his home, and then after he has mastered the principles he is
 given a practical road course. We recommend this School as a reliable
 institution."




How to get an Automobile Absolutely Free


As we told you in another part of this book--_WE ARE BUILDING
AUTOMOBILES_--a machine of the highest quality and the very latest
design, the specifications of which can be found on the last page of
this book.


_AGENTS WANTED_

We desire agents in every county in the United States and to those who
take our course, either the correspondence or the practical course, we
make this offer:

First, as soon as you have commenced to take our course we give you the
right to sell the _COEY FLYER_, and for every one you sell, we will
send you $200.00 in gold, and then after you have sold ten machines, we
will send you one _ABSOLUTELY FREE_, and prepay the freight on same to
any part of the United States, so that it is delivered to you free from
all cost.

We will extend this offer to no one who has not taken a course in our
School of Motoring, for we know that after you have taken this course,
you are capable of operating _ANY MACHINE_ without any trouble, and it
will be an advertisement for our School as well as for our machine.


_EVERY STUDENT MADE AN AGENT_

Second, as soon as you have commenced to take our course, we will send
you a quantity of circulars and a large poster which you can hang in
some conspicuous place, with your name in bold type at the bottom,
showing you as our agent.


_NOW GET BUSY!_

The Automobile business has come to stay and there will be many
machines sold in the next few months to people that you already know,
and if you let them know that you are our agent, they will be glad to
buy from you, as they will readily see that you can be of great help to
them when they commence to learn to run their machine, and they can buy
from you as cheaply as if they had come to Chicago and bought direct
from us.

We would suggest that in order to get a Coey Flyer in your locality
at once, that you go to someone whom you know is going to buy a
machine and tell him that if he will allow you to use his automobile
occasionally you will give him your commission, and if he knows that he
can save $200, he will be glad to do it.

This is the grandest offer ever made by anyone, and those who take
advantage of it will thank us a thousand times. Just think--a chance to
get rich for only $15.00. Have you ever had such an offer?

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
