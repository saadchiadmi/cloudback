THE article in this little book was published in _The Ladies' Home
Journal_ for April, 1915. Much to the surprise of the author, the call
for copies was so insistent as to exhaust the edition of the magazine
containing it. As the demand did not appear to be supplied, the article
is now reprinted in this form. It is sent out with the hope of the
author that it may still further fulfill its mission of giving the
stimulant of encouragement wherever it is needed.

                       WHY I BELIEVE IN POVERTY

           AS THE RICHEST EXPERIENCE THAT CAN COME TO A BOY

I MAKE my living trying to edit the "Ladies' Home Journal." And because
the public has been most generous in its acceptance of that periodical,
a share of that success has logically come to me. Hence a number of my
very good readers cherish an opinion that often I have been tempted to
correct, a temptation to which I now yield. My correspondents express
the conviction variously, but this extract from a letter is a fair
sample:--

It is all very easy for you to preach economy to us when you do not know
the necessity for it: to tell us how, as for example in my own case, we
must live within my husband's income of eight hundred dollars a year,
when you have never known what it is to live on less than thousands. Has
it ever occurred to you, born with the proverbial silver spoon in your
mouth, that theoretical writing is pretty cold and futile compared to
the actual hand-to-mouth struggle that so many of us live, day by day
and year in and year out--an experience that you know not of?

                   *       *       *       *       *

"An experience that you know not of"!

Now, how far do the facts square with this statement?

Whether or not I was born with the proverbial silver spoon in my mouth I
cannot say. It is true that I was born of well-to-do parents. But when I
was six years old my father lost all his means, and faced life at
forty-five, in a strange country, without even necessaries. There are
men and their wives who know what that means: for a man to try to "come
back" at forty-five, and in a strange country!

I had the handicap of not knowing one word of the English language. I
went to a public school and learned what I could. And sparse morsels
they were! The boys were cruel, as boys are. The teachers were
impatient, as tired teachers are.

My father could not find his place in the world. My mother, who had
always had servants at her beck and call, faced the problems of
housekeeping that she had never learned nor been taught. And there was
no money.

So, after school hours, my brother and I went home, but not to play.
After-school hours meant for us to help a mother who daily grew more
frail under the burdens that she could not carry. Not for days, but for
years, we two boys got up in the gray cold winter dawn when the bed
feels so snug and warm to growing boys, and we sifted the cold ashes of
the day-before fire for a stray lump or two of unburned coal, and with
what we had or could find we made the fire and warmed up the room. Then
we set the table for the scant breakfast, went to school, and directly
after school we washed the dishes, swept and scrubbed the floors. Living
in a three-family tenement, each third week meant that we scrubbed the
entire three flights of stairs from the third story to the first, as
well as the doorsteps and the side-walk outside. The latter work was the
hardest: for we did it on Saturdays with the boys of the neighborhood
looking on none too kindly, or we did it to the echo of the crack of the
ball and bat on the adjoining lot!

In the evening, when other could sit by the lamp or study their lessons,
we two boys went out with a basket and picked up wood and coal in the
neighboring lots, or went after the dozen or so pieces of coal left from
the ton of coal put in that afternoon by one of our neighbors, with the
spot hungrily fixed in mind by one of us during the day, hoping that the
man who carried in the coal might not be too careful in picking up the
stray lumps!

"An experience that you know not of"! Don't I?

At ten years of age I got my first job: washing the windows of a baker's
shop at fifty cents a week. In a week or two I was allowed to sell bread
and cakes behind the counter after school hours for a dollar a
week--handing out freshly baked cakes and warm, delicious smelling
bread, when scarcely a crumb had passed my mouth that day!

Then on Saturday mornings I served a route for a weekly paper, and sold
my remaining stock on the street. It meant from sixty to seventy cents
for that day's work.

I lived in Brooklyn, New York, and the chief means of transportation to
Coney Island at that time was the horse car. Near where we lived the
cars would stop to water the horses, the men would jump out and get a
drink of water, but the women had no means of quenching their thirst.
Seeing this lack I got a pail, filled it with water and a bit of ice,
and, with a glass, jumped on each car on Saturday afternoon and all day
Sunday, and sold my wares at a cent a glass. And when competition came,
as it did very quickly when other boys saw that a Sunday's work meant
two or three dollars, I squeezed a lemon or two in my pail, my liquid
became "lemonade" and my price two cents a glass, and Sundays meant five
dollars to me.

Then, in turn, I became a reporter during the evenings, an office boy
day-times, and learned stenography at midnight!

My correspondent says she supports her family of husband and child on
eight hundred dollars a year, and says I have never known what that
means. I supported a family of three on six dollars and twenty-five
cents a week--less than one half of her yearly income. When my brother
and I, combined, brought in eight hundred dollars a year we felt rich!

I have for the first time gone into these details in print so that my
readers may know, at first hand, that the

Editor of the "Ladies' Home Journal" is not a theorist when he writes or
prints articles that seek to preach economy or that reflect a
hand-to-hand struggle on a small or an invisible income. There is not a
single step, not an inch, on the road of direst poverty that I do not
know or have not experienced. And, having experienced every thought,
every feeling, and every hardship that come to those who travel that
road, I say to-day that I rejoice with every boy who is going through
the same experiences.

Nor am I discounting or forgetting one single pang of the keen hardships
that such a struggle means. I would not to-day exchange my years of the
keenest hardship that a boy can know or pass through for any single
experience that could have come to me. I know what it means, not to earn
a dollar, but to earn two cents. I know the value of money as I could
have learned it or known it in no other way. I could have been trained
for my life-work in no surer way. I could not have arrived at a truer
understanding of what it means to face a day without a penny in hand,
not a loaf of bread in the cupboard, not a piece of kindling wood for
the fire--with nothing to eat, and then be a boy with the hunger of nine
and ten, with a mother frail and discouraged!

"An experience that you know not of"! Don't I?

And yet I rejoice in the experience, and I repeat: I envy every boy who
is in that condition and going through it. But--and here is the pivot of
my strong belief in poverty as an undisguised blessing to a boy--I
believe in poverty as a condition to experience, to go through, and then
to get out of: not as a condition to stay in. "That's all very well,"
some will say; "easy enough to say, but how can you get out of it?" No
one can definitely tell another that. No one told me. No two persons can
find the same way out. Each must find his way for himself. That depends
on the boy. I was determined to get out of poverty because my mother was
not born in it, could not stand it, and did not belong in it. This gave
me the first essential: a purpose. Then I backed up the purpose with
effort and a willingness to work, and to work at anything that came my
way, no matter what it was, so long as it meant "the way out." I did not
pick and choose: I took what came, and did it in the best way I knew
how; and when I didn't like what I was doing I still did it well while I
was doing it, but I saw to it that I didn't do it any longer than I had
to do it. I used every rung in the ladder as a rung to the one above. It
meant effort, of course, untiring, ceaseless, and unsparing, and it
meant work, hard as nails. But out of the effort and the work came the
experience; the upbuilding; the development; the capacity to understand
and sympathize; the greatest heritage that can come to a boy. And
nothing in the world can give that to a boy, so that it will burn into
him, as will poverty.

That is why I believe so strongly in poverty, the greatest blessing in
the way of the deepest and fullest experience that can come to a boy.
But, as I repeat: always as a condition to work out of, not to stay in.

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
