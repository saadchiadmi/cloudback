THE PHILOSOPHY OF BREAKFAST


The breakfast habit is of antique origin. Presumably the primeval man
arose from troubled dreams, in the first gray light of dawn, and set
forth upon devious forest trails, seeking that which he might devour,
while the primeval woman still slumbered in her cave. Nowadays, it is
the lady herself who rises while the day is yet young, slips into a
kimono, and patters out into the kitchen to light the gas flame under
the breakfast food.

In this matter of breaking the fast, each house is law unto itself.
There are some who demand a dinner at seven or eight in the morning,
and others who consider breakfast utterly useless. The Englishman, who
is still mighty on the face of the earth, eats a breakfast which would
seriously tax the digestive apparatus of an ostrich or a goat, and
goes on his way rejoicing.

In an English cook-book only seven years old, menus for "ideal"
breakfasts are given, which run as follows:

"Devilled Drum-sticks and Eggs on the dish, Pigs Feet, Buttered
Toast, Dry Toast, Brown and White Bread and Butter, Marmalade and
Porridge."

"Bloaters on Toast, Collared Tongue, Hot Buttered Toast, Dry Toast,
Marmalade, Brown and White Bread and Butter, Bread and Milk."

"Pigeon Pie, Stewed Kidney, Milk Rolls, Dry Toast, Brown and White
Bread and Butter, Mustard and Cress, Milk Porridge."

And for a "simple breakfast,"--in August, mind you!--this is
especially recommended:

"Bloaters on Toast, Corned Beef, Muffins, Brown and White Bread and
Butter, Marmalade, and Boiled Hominy."

An American who ate a breakfast like that in August probably would not
send his collars to the laundry more than once or twice more, but it
takes all kinds of people to make up a world.

Across the Channel from the brawny Briton is the Frenchman, who, with
infinitely more wisdom, begins his day with a cup of coffee and a
roll. So far, so good, but his _déjeuner à la fourchette_ at eleven or
twelve is not always unobjectionable from a hygienic standpoint. The
"uniform breakfast," which is cheerfully advocated by some, may be
hygienic but it is not exciting. Before the weary mental vision
stretches an endless procession of breakfasts, all exactly alike, year
in and year out. It is quite possible that the "no-breakfast" theory
was first formulated by some one who had been, was, or was about to be
a victim of this system.

The "no-breakfast" plan has much to recommend it, however. In the
first place, it saves a deal of trouble. The family rises, bathes
itself, puts on its spotless raiment in leisurely and untroubled
fashion, and proceeds to the particular business of the day. There are
no burnt toast, soggy waffles, muddy coffee, heavy muffins, or pasty
breakfast food to be reckoned with. Theoretically, the energy supplied
by last night's dinner is "on tap," waiting to be called upon. And,
moreover, one is seldom hungry in the morning, and what is the use of
feeding a person who is not hungry?

It has been often said, and justly, that Americans eat too much.
Considering the English breakfast, however, we may metaphorically pat
ourselves upon the back, for there is no one of us, surely, who taxes
the Department of the Interior thus.

"What is one man's meat is another man's poison" has been held
pointedly to refer to breakfast, for here, as nowhere else, is the
individual a law unto himself. Fruit is the satisfaction of one and
the distress of another; cereal is a life-giving food to one and a
soggy mass of indigestibility to some one else; and coffee, which is
really most innocent when properly made, has lately taken much blame
for sins not its own.

Quite often the discomfort caused by the ill-advised combination of
acid fruit with a starchy cereal has been attributed to the clear,
amber beverage which probably was the much-vaunted "nectar of the
gods." Coffee with cream in it may be wrong for some people who could
use boiling milk with impunity.

For a woman who spends the early part of the day at home, the omission
of breakfast may be salutary. When hunger seizes her, she is within
reach of her own kitchen, where proper foods may be properly cooked,
but for a business woman or man the plan is little less than suicidal.
Mr. Man may, indeed, go down town in comfort, with no thought of food,
but, no later than noon, he is keenly desirous of interior decoration.
Within his reach there is, usually, but the lunch counter, where, in
company with other hapless humans, he sustains himself with leathery
pie, coffee which never met the coffee bean, and the durable doughnut
of commerce. The result is--to put it mildly--discontent, which
seemingly has no adequate cause.

It is better, by far, for Mr. Man to eat a breakfast which shall
contain the proteids, carbohydrates, phosphates, and starches that he
will require during the day, and omit the noon luncheon entirely,
except, perhaps, for a bit of fruit. Moreover, a dainty breakfast,
daintily served, has a distinct æsthetic value. The temper of the
individual escorted to the front door by a devoted spouse has more
than a little to do with the temper of the selfsame individual who is
let in at night by the aforesaid D. S.

Many a man is confronted in the morning by an untidy, ill-cooked
breakfast, a frowsy woman and a still frowsier baby, and, too often,
by querulous whinings and complaints.

The ancient Britons had a pleasing arrangement which they called "The
Truce of God." By this, there was no fighting whatever, no matter what
the provocation, between sunset on Wednesday and sunrise on Monday.
This gave time for other affairs, and for the exercise of patience,
toleration, and other virtues of the same ilk.

Many a household might take a leaf from this book to good advantage.
Settle all differences after dinner, since at no time of the day is
man in more reasonable mood, and ordain a "Truce of God" from dawn
until after dinner.

No dinner, however beautifully cooked and served, no fine raiment,
however costly and becoming, can ever atone, in the memory of a man,
for the wild and untamed morning which too often prevails in the
American household. His mind, distraught with business cares, harks
back to his home--with pleasure? None too often, more's the pity.

Some one has said that, in order to make a gentleman, one must begin
with the grandfather. It is equally true that a good and proper
breakfast begins the night before--or, better yet, the morning before.

Careful, systematic planning in advance lightens immeasurably the
burden of housekeeping, and, many a time, makes the actual work
nothing but fun. Those who have tried the experiment of planning meals
for the entire week are enthusiastic in praise of the system. It
secures variety, simplifies marketing, arranges for left-overs, and
gives many an hour of peace and comfort which could not be had
otherwise.

Even if a woman be her own maid, as, according to statistics,
eighty-five per cent. of us are, a dainty, hygienic, satisfying
breakfast is hers and her lord's for little more than the asking. By
careful preparation in advance, the morning labor is reduced to a
minimum; by the intelligent use of lists and memoranda, the weary and
reluctant body is saved many an unnecessary step.

An alarm clock of the "intermittent" sort insures early rising, a dash
of cold water on the face is a physical and mental tonic of the most
agreeable kind, and one hour in the morning is worth two at night, as
the grandmothers of all of us have often said.

Fruit, usually, may be prepared for serving the night before, and will
be improved by a few hours in the refrigerator. Cereals should be
soaked over night in the water in which they are to be cooked, and a
few hours' cooking in the afternoon will injure very few cereals
destined for the breakfast table the next morning. Codfish balls and
many other things will be none the worse for a night's waiting; the
table can be set, and everything made ready for a perfect breakfast,
which half an hour of intelligent effort in the morning will readily
evolve.

A plea is made for the use of the chafing-dish, which is fully as
attractive at the breakfast table as in the "wee sma' hours" in which
it usually shines; for a white apron instead of a gingham one when "my
lady" is also the cook; for a crisp, clean shirt-waist instead of an
abominable dressing-sack; for smooth, tidy hair, instead of unkempt
locks; for a collar and a belt, and a persistent, if determined,
cheerfulness.

In the long run, these things pay, and with compound interest at that.
They involve a certain amount of labor, a great deal of careful
planning, eternal getting-up when it is far more pleasant to abide in
dreamland, quite often a despairing weariness, if not a headache, and
no small draft upon one's power of self-denial and self-sacrifice.

But he who goes in the morning from a quiet, comfortable, well-ordered
house, with a pleasant memory of the presiding genius of his
hearthstone, is twice the man that his fellow may be, whose wife
breakfasts at ten in her bed, or, frowsy and unkempt, whines at him
from across a miserable breakfast--twice as well fitted for the
ceaseless grind of an exhausting day in the business arena, whence he
returns at night, footsore, weary, and depressed, to the four walls
wherein he abides.

    "How far that little candle throws its beams!
    So shines a good deed in a naughty world."

To some, this may seem an undue stress laid upon the material side of
existence, but the human animal needs animal comforts even more than
his brother of forest and field, and from such humble beginnings great
things may come, not the least of which is the fine, spiritual essence
of a happy home.




HOW TO SET THE TABLE


Having said so much, we proceed, not to our mutton, as the French have
it, but to our breakfast, in which the table plays no small nor
unimportant part.

There are rumors that the pretty and sensible fashion of doilies on
the bare table is on the wane, but let us hope these are untrue, or,
if not, that some of us may have the courage of our convictions and
continue to adhere to a custom which has everything in its favor and
nothing against it.

In the absence of handsome top of oak or mahogany, the breakfast
cloths, fringed or not, as one likes, which are about a yard and a
quarter square, are the next best thing. Asbestos mats, under the
cloth, protect the table from the hot dishes. Failing these, fairly
satisfactory substitutes are made from thin white oil-cloth, between
two layers of canton flannel, "fur side outside," and quilted on the
machine. Grass table-mats are also used, but always under cloth or
doily. Canton flannel, quilted, three layers to a mat, is easily
washed, and furnishes a great deal of protection.

Breakfast, most assuredly, is not dinner, and there should be a
distinct difference in the laying of the table. The small doilies are
easily washed, and fresh ones are possible every morning--an assured
gain in the way of daintiness.

Let us suppose that we have a handsome table-top, and an unlimited
supply of doilies, tray-cloths and centrepieces. First the centrepiece
goes on, exactly in the centre, by the way, and not with a prejudiced
leaning to one side or the other. On this belongs the pot of growing
fern, the low jar containing a few simple flowers, or a bowl of fruit,
decorated with green leaves, if green leaves are to be had.

At each place the breakfast doily, nine or twelve inches square, a
small doily for the coffee cup, and another for the glass of water. At
the right of the plate, the small silver knife, sharp edge toward the
plate, the spoons for fruit and cereal; at the left, one fork, or two,
as needed, and the coffee spoon.

In front of the master of the house the small platter containing the
_pièce de résistance_ will eventually be placed; in front of the
mistress of the mansion, the silver tray bearing the coffee
service--coffee-pot, hot-water pitcher, cream jug, milk pitcher, and
sugar bowl.

Breakfast napkins are smaller than dinner napkins, and the small
fringed napkins are not out of place. "Costly thy habit as thy purse
will buy" might well refer to linen, for it is the one thing in which
price is a direct guarantee of quality.

Satisfactory breakfast cloths and napkins are made of linen sheeting,
fringed, hemstitched, or carefully hemmed by hand, and in this way a
pretty cloth can be had for less money than in any other. The linen
wears well, washes beautifully, and acquires a finer sheen with every
tubbing. Insertions and borders of torchon or other heavy lace make a
breakfast cloth suitable for the most elaborate occasion, and separate
doilies may easily be made to match. The heavy white embroidery which
has recently come into favor is unusually attractive here.

Finger-bowls wait on the sideboard, to be placed after the fruit
course, or after breakfast. The rose-water, slice of lemon, geranium
leaves, and other finger-bowl refinements in favor for dinners are out
of place at breakfast. Clear, cool water is in better taste.

The china used at the breakfast table should be different from that
used at dinner. Heavier ware is permissible, and more latitude in the
way of decoration is given. Much of the breakfast china one sees in
the shops is distinctly cheerful in tone, and one must take care to
select the more quiet patterns. It is not pleasant to go to breakfast
with a fickle appetite, and be greeted by a trumpet-toned "Good
Morning" from the china.

Endless difference is allowed, however, and all the quaint, pretty
jugs, pitchers, and plates may properly be used at breakfast. One is
wise, however, to have a particular color scheme in mind and to buy
all china to blend with it. Blue and white is a good combination, and
is, perhaps, more suitable for the morning meal than anything else. As
a certain philosopher says: "The blue and white look so pretty with
the eggs!"

The carafe, muffin plate, platter, and all other bowls, platters,
plates, and pitchers not on the individual cover have each a separate
doily, with the protecting mat always under hot dishes. A well-set
table is governed by a simple law--that of precision. Dishes arranged
in an order little less than military, all angles either right or
acute, will, for some occult reason, always look well. Informality may
be given by the arrangement of the flowers, or by a flower or two laid
carelessly on the table. But one must be careful not to trifle too
much with this law of precision. Knives, forks, and spoons must all be
laid straight, but not near enough together to touch, and napkins and
dishes must be precisely placed, else confusion and riot will result.

The breakfast selected as a type consists of fruit, a cereal, salt
fish, or salt meat, or eggs, or omelets, hot bread of some kind, and
pancakes or waffles, or coffee cake, one dish from each group, and
coffee. Six dishes in all, which may be less if desired, but never
more. All six form a breakfast sufficiently hearty for a stone mason
or a piano mover; one or two give a breakfast light enough to tempt
those who eat no breakfast at all. For serving it are required small
and medium-sized plates, knives, forks, spoons, egg cups, platters,
service plates, cups and saucers, glasses, coffee-pot, pitchers, sugar
bowl, and cream jug, syrup pitcher, and fruit bowl.

Fruit is said to be "gold in the morning," and it is a poor breakfast,
indeed, from which it is omitted. Even in winter it is not hard to
secure variety, if time and thought be taken, for the dried fruits are
always in the market and by careful cooking may be made acceptable to
the most uncertain appetite.

Medical authorities recommend a glass of water taken the first thing
upon rising, either hot or cold as suits one best. A little
lemon-juice takes the "flat" taste from plain hot water, and clear,
cool water, not iced, needs nothing at all. This simple observance of
a very obvious hygienic rule will temper the tempestuous morning for
any one. One washes his face, his hands, his body--then why not his
stomach, which has worked hard a large part of the night, and is
earnestly desirous of the soothing refreshment of a bath?

To those carping critics who cavil at the appearance of the stomach
in a chapter entitled "How to Set the Table," we need only say that
the table is set for the stomach, and the stomach should be set for
the table, and anyway, it comes very near being a table of contents,
_n'est-ce pas_?




THE KITCHEN RUBAIYAT


    Wake, for the Alarm Clock scatters into Flight
    The variegated Nightmares of the Night;
      Allures the Gas into the Kitchen Range
    And pleads for Rolls and Muffins that are Light.

    Before the Splendor of the last Dream died
    Methought a Voice from out my Doorway cried:
      "When all the Breakfast is Prepared for him
    Why doth my lord within his Crib abide?"

    And, as the cat Purred, she who was Before
    Within the Kitchen shouted: "Guard the Door!
      Else this new Bridget will have Flown the Coop
    And, once Departed, will Return no More!"

    All maids in sight the Wise One gladly Hires
    And one of them she Presently acquires,
      Yet toward the Bureau does not fail to Look
    Because all Maids, as well as Men, are liars.

    For Mary Ann has gone, with all her Woes,
    And Dinah, too, has fled--where, no one knows,
      But still a Bridget from the Bureau comes
    And many a Tekla of her Reference blows.

    Come, fill the Cup, and let the Kettle Sing!
    The Cream and Sugar and Hot Water bring!
      Methinks this fragrant liquid amber here
    Within the Pot, is pretty much the Thing.

    Each Morn a thousand Cereals brings, you say?
    Yes, but where leaves the Food of Yesterday?
      And this same Grocer man that sells us Nerve
    Shall take Pa's Wheat and Mother's Oats away.

    For lo, my small Back Yard is thickly Strown
    With Ki-Tee-Munch, Chew-Chew, and Postman's Own
      Where Apple-Nuts and Strength have been Forgot--
    Ah, how these Papers by the Winds are Blown!

    The tender Waffle hearts are Set upon
    Is either Crisp or Soggy, and Anon
      Like Maple Syrup made of corn and Cobs
    Lasts but a scant Five Minutes, and is Gone.

    I often think that never gets so Red
    My flower-like Nose as when I've just been Fed
      And after Breakfast, in the Glass I look,
    And never Fail to Wish that I were dead.

    And this faint Sallow Place upon my Mien--
    How came it There? From that fair Coffee Bean?
      Ah, take the Glass away! Make Haste unless
    You want to see my Whole Complexion green.

    When I was Younger, I did oft Frequent
    The Married Bunch, and heard Great Argument
      About the Fearful Price of Eggs, and How
    To get a Dollar's Work out of a Cent.

    And when I asked them of their Recompense,
    What did they Get for Keeping Down Expense--
      Oh, many a cup of Coffee, Steaming Hot,
    Must drown the Memory of their Insolence!

    If I were Married 't would be my Desire
    To get up Every Morn and Build the Fire
      For fear my Husband should use Kerosene,
    And, without warning, be transported Higher.

    Ah, with the Coffee all my Years provide!
    Its chemicals may turn me green Inside,
      But all my Fears are Scattered to the Winds
    When o'er the fragrant Pot I can Preside.

    I blame our Mother Eve, who did mistake
    Her Job, and flirted Somewhat with the Snake,
      For all the Errors of the Flaky Roll,
    For all the Terrors of the Buckwheat Cake.

    A glass of Creamy Milk just from the Cow,
    Or Buttermilk, drawn from the Goat, I trow,
      And thou across the Festal Board from Me,
    A Six-Room Flat were Paradise enow!

    Some for a Patent Bread that will not Crumb,
    And nary Bite of Cereal for Some--
      Ah, take the Coffee! Let all else go by
    Nor heed the Thick White Fur upon the Tongue.

    Look to the Human Wrecks about us: lo,
    About their Indigestion how they Blow,
      And lay the Blame on Coffee, crystal Clear,
    Or say the Crisp Hot Muffin is their Foe!

    And those who chew and chew upon the Grain,
    Have got so used to Chewing, they are Fain
      To Dwell upon their Health Food in their Talk
    And presently their Neighbors go Insane.

The above table, of course, is only a rough outline, as seasons and
localities vary so much. The tendency, too, is to extend the season of
every fruit indefinitely, as transporting and refrigerating methods
improve. Fruit out of season is always expensive, and often unripe and
unsatisfactory. Fortunately, when it is at its best it is always
abundant and at the lowest price.

Among the dried fruits may be mentioned Prunelles, Apricots, Apples,
Blackberries, Cherries, Nectarines, Peaches, peeled and unpeeled,
Pears, Plums, Raspberries, Prunes, Figs, and Dates. Canned fruits
which may be used for breakfast, with proper preparation, are Pears,
Peaches, Apricots, Cherries, Plums, and Pineapples.

Dried fruits may be soaked over night in the water in which they are
to be cooked, and simmered slowly, until they are tender, with little
sugar or none at all. They may also be steamed, either with or
without sugar, omitting the soaking, until tender enough for a straw
to pierce. Combinations of dried fruits are often agreeable, and a few
raisins will sometimes add a pleasant flavor.

Canned fruits intended for breakfast should be drained and very
thoroughly rinsed in cold water, then allowed to stand for some hours
in a cool place.

Many of the fruits, both dried and fresh, combine well with cereals.
Care must be taken, however, to follow such acid fruits as Currants,
Cherries, Oranges, and Grapefruit, with meat or egg dishes, omitting
the cereal, as the starch and acid are very likely to fight with each
other when once inside, to the inconvenience of the non-combatant. A
fruit which for any reason tastes "flat" can be instantly improved in
flavor and tonic quality by a sprinkle of lemon-juice.

Below are given different ways of preparing fruit for the breakfast
table.


APPLES

I. When served whole, apples should be carefully washed and rubbed to
a high polish with a crash towel. Only perfect fruit should be served
in this way, and green leaves in the fruit bowl are especially
desirable. Fruit-knives are essential.

II. Pare, quarter, and core good eating apples, removing all
imperfections. Serve a few quarters on each plate, with or without
sugar. A sprinkle of cinnamon or lemon-juice will improve fruit which
has little flavor. A grating of nutmeg may also be used.

III. _À la Condé._--Pare, quarter, and core good cooking apples.
Arrange in rows in an earthen baking-dish, sprinkle with powdered
sugar and lemon-juice, pour a little water into the baking-dish, and
add a heaping tablespoonful of butter. Bake slowly, basting frequently
with the apple-juice and melted butter. When tender, take out, drain,
and cool, saving the juice. Serve with boiled rice or other cereal,
using the juice instead of milk.

IV. _À la Cherbourg._--Pare and core good cooking apples; halve or
quarter if desired. Cook slowly in a thin syrup flavored with
lemon-peel and a bit of ginger-root. Serve separately or with cereal.

V. _À la Fermière._--Pare and core the apples and arrange in a
well-buttered baking-dish. Sprinkle slightly with sugar and cinnamon;
baste often with melted butter, and serve with boiled rice or other
cereal, using the juice instead of milk.

VI. _À la Française._--Core and then peel tart apples. Put into cold
water from half an inch to an inch in depth, sprinkle with sugar,
cover tightly, and cook very slowly on the back part of the range
till tender. Flavorings already noted may be added at pleasure. Skim
out the apples, reduce the remaining syrup one-half by rapid boiling,
pour over the apples, and cool. Serve cold, with or without cereal.

VII. _À la Ninon._--Sprinkle baked apples with freshly grated cocoanut
on taking from the oven. Serve on a mound of boiled rice with the milk
of the cocoanut.

VIII. _À la Réligieuse._--Core cooking apples; score the skin deeply
in a circle all around the fruit. Sprinkle a little sugar in the
cores, and dissolve a little currant jelly in the water used for the
basting. Cook slowly, and baste once with melted butter. The peel is
supposed to rise all around the apple, like a veil--hence the name.

IX. _Baked._--Peel or not, as preferred. Sprinkle with melted butter
and sugar, baste now and then with hot water, and serve separately or
with cereal.

X. _Baked, with Bananas._--Core, draw a peeled and scraped banana
through each core, trimming the ends off even, and bake slowly,
basting with hot water, melted butter, and lemon-juice. The apples may
be peeled if desired. Serve separately, or with cereal.

XI. _Baked, with Cereal._--Pare or not, as preferred, but core. Fill
the centres with left-over cooked cereal and bake slowly. Butter,
lemon-juice, or any flavoring recommended before can be used to
advantage. Any quartered apples, baked or stewed, can be covered with
any preferred cereal, and served with sugar and cream.

XII. _Baked, with Cherries._--Core the apples, fill the centres with
pitted cherries, either sour or sweet, bake carefully, basting with
syrup and melted butter. The apples may be peeled or not. Take up
carefully, and serve separately, or with cereal.

XIII. _Baked, with Currants._--Fill the centres with currants, red or
white, and use plenty of sugar. Baste with hot water or melted butter.
May be served with cereal if enough sugar is used in baking.

XIV. _Baked, with Dates._--Wash and stone dates, fill the cores of
apples with them, sprinkle with powdered sugar and bake, basting with
butter, lemon-juice, and hot water. The apples may be peeled or not.

XV. _Baked, with Figs._--Wash the figs carefully, and pack into the
cores of apples. Bake, basting with lemon syrup and melted butter.
Serve separately or with cereal.

XVI. _Baked, with Gooseberries._--Cap and stem a handful of
gooseberries. Fill the cores of large, firm apples with them, using
plenty of sugar. Baste with melted butter and hot water. May be
served with cereal if plenty of sugar is used in cooking.

XVII. _Baked, with Prunes._--Select tart apples, and peel or not, as
preferred. Core and fill the centres with stewed prunes, stoned and
drained. Bake slowly, basting with the prune-juice, or with
lemon-juice, melted butter, spiced syrup, or hot water containing
grated lemon-peel and a teaspoonful of sherry. Two or three cloves may
be stuck into each apple, and removed after the apples are cold.
Serve, very cold, with cream; separately, or with a cereal.

XVIII. _Baked, with Quinces._--Fill the cores of sweet apples with
bits of quince and plenty of sugar. Bake slowly, basting with melted
butter and syrup. Serve separately or with cereal.

XIX. _Baked, with Spice._--Select very sour apples, and peel or not,
as preferred. Core, and stuff the cavities with brown sugar, putting
two whole cloves into each apple. Baste with hot water containing a
bit of grated lemon-peel and a teaspoonful of sherry, putting a
teaspoonful of butter into the liquor as it forms in the dish. Bake
slowly, covered, until the apples are very tender. Serve separately or
with a cereal. Cinnamon, or nutmeg, or a blade of mace may be used
instead of the cloves.

XX. _Boiled._--Boil slowly in a saucepan with as little water as
possible. Do not peel. When tender, lift out, add sugar to the water
in which they were boiled; reduce half by rapid boiling, pour over the
apples, and let cool. Currant-juice, lemon-juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, or
a suspicion of clove may be added to the syrup if the apples lack
flavor.

XXI. _Coddled._--Core, cut in halves, but do not peel. Lay in the
bottom of an earthen dish, sprinkle lightly with sugar, add a little
water, and cook very slowly on the top of the stove until tender.

XXII. _Crusts._--Cut stale bread in circles, lay half of a peeled and
cored apple on each piece. Bake carefully, basting with melted butter
and a little lemon-juice if desired. When the apples are done,
sprinkle with powdered sugar, and take from the oven. Serve either hot
or cold.

XXIII. _Dried._--Soak over night in water to cover, after washing
thoroughly; cook slowly until soft, sweeten, and flavor with lemon.
Raisins, dates, figs, or other dried fruits may be added at pleasure.

XXIV. _Fried._--Core, but do not pare. If very juicy, dredge with
flour and fry slowly in hot fat till tender. They are served with
pork, or, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon, with cereals.

XXV. _Glazed._--Core tart apples. Fill the centres with cinnamon,
sugar, bits of butter, and a raisin or two. Bake slowly, basting with
lemon-syrup. When nearly done, brush with the beaten white of egg and
sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve separately or with cereal.

XXVI. _In Bloom._--Cook pared red apples in any preferred way, and
stew the skin separately, in a little water, until the color is
extracted. The tiniest bit of red vegetable coloring may be needed.
Strain this liquid, and pour it over the apples when done. Or, add
currant jelly to color the water in which the apples are boiled, or to
the water for basting pared baked apples.

XXVII. _In Casserole._--Arrange good cooking apples in an earthen
casserole. Cover with a thin syrup made of brown sugar, add a little
spice and a bit of orange- or lemon-peel. Bake, very slowly, tightly
covered. Serve cold from the casserole.

XXVIII. _In Crumbs._--Cut strips of stale bread to fit stone
custard-cups. Dip in milk, and arrange in the moulds. Fill the centres
with apple sauce, cover with a circle of the bread, and steam thirty
minutes. Serve cold, with cream.

XXIX. _In Rice-Cups._--Line buttered custard cups with cold boiled
rice. Fill the centres with apple sauce or cooked quartered apples,
mildly tart rather than sweet. Cover with more of the rice. Steam
half an hour and let cool in the cups. Turn out on chilled plates and
serve with cream. Cream may be used with any cooked apple, if the
Secretary of the Interior files no objections. Cereals, other than
rice, left over, can be used in the same way. A wreath of cooked apple
quarters around the base of each individual mould is a dainty and
acceptable garnish.

XXX. _Jellied._--Cut tart apples in halves, core, place in buttered
baking-dish, skin side down, measure the water and add enough barely
to cover; add twice as much sugar as water, cover and boil slowly till
the apples are tender. Skim out, drain, boil the syrup rapidly till
reduced one half; pour over the apples and let cool. Flavorings
referred to before can be added to the syrup if desired.

XXXI. _Mock Pineapple._--Arrange alternate slices of sweet apples and
oranges, peeled, on a chilled plate, one above the other. Sprinkle
with powdered sugar, pour over the orange-juice and serve immediately.

XXXII. _Sauce._--Peel, quarter, and core quick-cooking apples. Sweeten
slightly, and when very tender, rub through a sieve and let cool. Any
flavoring recommended before may be used.

XXXIII. _Snow._--Peel white-fleshed, firm apples, grate quickly on a
coarse grater, and serve in roughly piled heaps on small plates
immediately. Use sugar or not.

XXXIV. _Southern, Fried._--Core and cut in thick slices, but do not
peel. Dip in egg and crumbs and fry in ham or bacon fat and serve with
those meats.

XXXV. _Stewed._--Pare, core, and halve large cooking-apples. Put into
an earthen dish, cover with water, sprinkle with sugar, cover tightly,
and cook slowly. If flat in taste, sprinkle with lemon-juice,
cinnamon, or nutmeg.

XXXVI. _Stewed with Dates._--Add washed and stoned dates to stewed
apples when partially cooked, and finish cooking. Dried apricots,
fresh or dried cherries, rhubarb, figs, plums, dried peaches, pears,
or quinces, may be used in the same way.

XXXVII. _Stewed with Rice._--Boil rice as usual in boiling water,
adding a little salt. When partly done, add pared, cored, and
quartered quick-cooking apples. Finish cooking. Serve very cold with
cream and sugar. Flavorings noted above may be added at discretion.


APRICOTS

I. Wipe with a dry cloth and serve with fruit-knives. A green leaf on
each plate is a dainty fruit doily.

II. _Canned._--Drain, rinse in cold water, arrange on plates, and let
stand several hours before serving. Sugar or not, as desired. Save the
syrup to flavor syrup for pancakes, or to use for puddings, fritters,
etc.

III. _Dried._--Soak over night, cook very slowly in the water in which
they were soaked, adding very little sugar. Serve with cereal, or
separately.

IV. _Sauce._--Cook as above, and rub the fruit through a sieve. The
canned, drained, and freshened fruit may be used in the same way.


BANANAS

I. Serve in the skins with fruit-knives, one to each person.

II. Skin and scrape and serve immediately. People who cannot
ordinarily eat bananas usually find them harmless when the tough,
stringy pulp is scraped off.

III. _Baked._--Bake without peeling, basting with hot water and melted
butter occasionally. Let cool in the skins.

IV. _Baked._--Skin, scrape, and bake, basting with lemon-juice and
melted butter. Sprinkle with sugar if desired.

V. _Au naturel._--Slice into saucers, sprinkle with lemon-juice and
sugar.

VI. _With Sugar and Cream._--Slice, sprinkle with powdered sugar, pour
cream over, and serve at once.

VII. _With Oranges._--Slice, add an equal quantity of sliced oranges,
and sprinkle with sugar.

VIII. _With Cereal._--Slice fresh bananas into a saucer, sprinkle with
sugar, cover with boiled rice or with any preferred cereal.

IX. Equally good with sliced peaches.


BLACKBERRIES

Serve with powdered sugar, with or without cream. A tablespoonful of
cracked ice in a saucer of berries is appreciated on a hot morning.


BLUE PLUMS

See Green Gages.


CHERRIES

I. Serve very cold, with the stems on. A dainty way is to lay the
cherries upon a bed of cracked ice, and serve with powdered sugar in
individual dishes.

II. Pit the cherries, saving the juice, and serve in saucers with
sugar and plenty of cracked ice.

III. _Iced._--Beat the white of an egg to a foam. Dip each cherry into
it, then roll in powdered sugar, and set on a platter in the
refrigerator. Must be prepared overnight.

IV. _Crusts._--Butter rounds of stale bread, spread with pitted
cherries and their juice, sprinkle with sugar, and bake. Serve very
cold.


CURRANTS

Serve in cracked ice with plenty of sugar. These are also served iced,
and on crusts. See Cherries III and IV.


FIGS

May be served from the basket. This, of course, applies only to the
more expensive varieties, which are clean. The ordinary dried fig of
commerce must be washed many times, and is usually sweet enough
without adding more sugar.

II. _Steamed._--Set a plate of figs in a steamer over boiling water
until plump and soft, then set away to cool.

III. _Stewed._--Clean, soak, and cook slowly till tender in a little
water. Skim out, drain, sweeten the syrup slightly, reduce one half,
pour over the figs, and cool. A bit of vanilla or wine may be added to
the syrup.

IV. _With Cereal._--Cover a saucer of steamed or stewed figs with any
preferred cereal. Serve with cream if desired.

V. _In Rice-Cups._--See Apples XXIX.

VI. _In Crumbs._--See Apples XXVIII.


GOOSEBERRIES

These berries must be stewed in order to be acceptable. The fruit,
after stewing, may be rubbed through a sieve fine enough to keep back
the seeds, or it may be baked on crusts. See Cherries IV.


GRAPES

This luscious fruit is at its best when served fresh from the vines,
with the bloom still on. Never wash a bunch of grapes if it can be
avoided. Serve with grape scissors to cut the bunches apart. People
who fear appendicitis may have the grapes squeezed from the skins and
the seeds afterwards removed. They are very nice this way, with sugar
and pounded ice.


GRAPEFRUIT

A good grapefruit will have dark spots, a skin which seems thin, will
be firm to the touch, and heavy for its size. To serve, cut crosswise,
and remove the white, bitter pulp which is in the core, and separate
the sections. Fill the core with sugar and serve cold. A little rum or
kirsch may be added just before serving, but, as George Ade said, "A
good girl needs no help," and it is equally true of a good grapefruit.
If anybody knows why it is called grapefruit, please write to the
author of this book in care of the publishers.


GREEN GAGES

Serve as they come, with the bloom on, or peel, pit, and serve with
cracked ice and powdered sugar.


HUCKLEBERRIES

Look the fruit over carefully. Nothing pleases a fly so much as to die
and be mistaken for a huckleberry. Serve with cracked ice, with sugar
or cream, or both.


MUSKMELONS

Keep on ice till the last moment. Cut crosswise, take out the seeds
with a spoon, and put a cube of ice in each half. Green leaves on the
plate are a dainty touch.


ORANGES

Serve with fruit-knives, or in halves with spoons--either the
orange-spoon which comes for that purpose, or a very heavy teaspoon.
Another way is to remove the peel, except a strip an inch wide at the
equator, cut at a division line and straighten out the peel, taking
care not to break off the sections. Or, the fruit may be peeled,
sliced, and served on plates with sugar.


PEACHES

Wipe with a dry cloth and serve with fruit-knives. Or, if you think
much of your breakfast napkins, peel and cut just before serving, as
they discolor quickly. Serve with cracked ice, or with cream. Hard
peaches may be baked, as apples are, and served cold with cream.
Stewed peaches may be served on crusts.


PEARS

Serve as they come, with fruit-knives. Hard pears may be baked or
stewed according to directions previously given.


PINEAPPLE

Peel, cut out the eyes, and shred from the core with a silver fork.
Sprinkle with sugar and keep on ice some hours before serving.
Pineapple is the only fruit known to have a distinct digestive value,
and it works most readily on starches. It combines pleasantly with
bananas.


PRUNELLES

These are soaked, and boiled in the water in in which they are soaked,
with the addition of a very little sugar. Dried apricots,
blackberries, cherries, nectarines, and prunes are cooked in the same
way. They may also be steamed and afterwards sprinkled with sugar.


PRUNES

These are no longer despised since the price has gone up, and the more
expensive kinds are well worth having. A bit of lemon-peel or spice
may flavor the syrup acceptably, and they are especially healthful in
combination with cereals, according to recipes previously given.


QUINCES

Peel, stuff the cores with sugar, and bake according to directions
given for apples. A little lemon may be used in the syrup for basting.


RASPBERRIES AND STRAWBERRIES

These delicious berries should not be washed unless absolutely
necessary, nor should they be insulted with sugar and cream. If very
sour, strawberries may be dipped in powdered sugar. Large, fine ones
are served with the stems and hulls on. Raspberries, if ripe, seldom
need sugar. Cracked ice is a pleasing accompaniment.


RHUBARB

I. Peel, cut into inch-lengths, and stew with plenty of sugar. Serve
cold.

II. Cut, but do not peel, boil five minutes, then change the water
and cook slowly with plenty of sugar till done.

III. _Baked._--Do not peel. Cut into inch-pieces, put into a buttered
baking-dish or stone jar, sprinkle plentifully with sugar, and bake
slowly. It will be a rich red in color.

IV. Cook on crusts. See Cherries IV.

V. Add a handful of seeded raisins to rhubarb cooked in any of the
above ways when it is about half done. Figs, dates, and other dried
fruits, used with rhubarb, make a combination pleasing to some.


TANGERINES

See Oranges.


WATERMELON

Like muskmelon, watermelon must be very thoroughly chilled. Serve in
slices from a platter or on individual plates, removing the rind
before serving, if desired; or cut the melon in half, slice off the
lower end so that it may stand firmly, and serve the pulp from the
shell with a silver spoon. Ice pounded to snow is a pleasant addition
to any fruit, when the thermometer is ninety-five or six in the shade.




CEREALS


So many breakfast foods are upon the market that it would be
impossible to enumerate all of them, especially as new ones are
appearing continually. Full and complete directions for cooking all of
them are printed upon the packages in which they are sold. It may not
be amiss to add, however, that in almost every instance, twice or
three times the time allowed for cooking would improve the cereal in
taste and digestibility.

The uncooked cereals are many. A wise housekeeper will use the
uncooked cereals when she has no maid. "A word to the wise is
unnecessary."

Pleasing variety in the daily menu is secured by getting a different
cereal each time. In this way, it takes about a year to get back to
the beginning again, and there is no chance to tire of any of them.

Cereals should always be cooked in a double boiler; and soaking over
night in the water in which they are to be cooked, where it is not
possible to secure the necessary time for long cooking, will prove a
distinct advantage. Leftover cereals should be covered with cold
water immediately, in the double boiler, and kept in a cool place
until the next day. Bring slowly to a boil, and cook as usual. In the
hot weather, cereals may be cooked the day before using, moulded in
custard-cups, and kept in the ice-box over night. They are very
acceptable when served ice-cold, and, if moulded with fruit, or served
with fruit on the same plate, so much the better.

Pearled wheat, pearled barley, and coarse hominy require five cupfuls
of water to each cup of cereal, and need from four to six hours'
cooking. Coarse oatmeal and fine hominy must be cooked from four to
six hours, but need only four cupfuls of water to each cup of cereal.
Rolled wheat and rolled barley are cooked two hours in three times as
much water as cereal; rice and rolled oats, with three times as much
water, will cook in one hour. Farina, with six cupfuls of water to
each cupful of cereal, also cooks in an hour; cerealine flakes cook in
thirty minutes, equal parts of water and cereal being used.

Salt must be added just before cooking begins. All cereals are richer
if a little milk is added to the water in which they are cooked.

To cook cereals in a double boiler, put the water into the inner
kettle, the outer vessel being from half to two thirds full, and when
it is boiling furiously, sprinkle in the cereal, a few grains at a
time, and not so rapidly as to stop the boiling. When cereals are
eaten cold, they require a little more liquid.


BOILED BARLEY

Wash the barley in several waters, cover with cold water; bring to a
boil, drain, cover with fresh boiling water, add a little salt, and
cook slowly for four hours.


BARLEY GRUEL

Wash half a cupful of pearled barley in several waters; put it into a
double boiler with eight cupfuls of water and half an inch of stick
cinnamon. Boil for two hours, strain, sweeten, and add two wine
glasses of port. Keep in a cool place and reheat when required. An
invaluable breakfast cereal for a convalescent.

BREWIS

Dry bread in the oven so slowly that it is a light brown in color.
Crush into crumbs with the rolling-pin and sift through the
frying-basket. Measure the milk, salt it slightly, and bring to a
boil. Put in half as much of the dried crumbs. Boil five or ten
minutes, season with butter, pepper, and salt, and serve at once with
cream. It must be stirred all the time it is cooking. By omitting the
butter, it may be served with sugar. Brown, rye, graham, or corn bread
may be mixed with the white bread to advantage. The dried and sifted
crumbs of brown bread, when served cold with cream, taste surprisingly
like a popular cereal which etiquette forbids us to mention. This is a
good way to use up accumulated crumbs.


CORN-MEAL MUSH

The best meal comes from the South. It is white, moist, and coarse,
and is called "water ground." It is a very different proposition from
the dry, yellow powder sold in Northern groceries. For mush, use four
times as much water as meal. Salt the water, and sprinkle in the meal
very slowly when it is at a galloping boil. Boil an hour or more,
stirring frequently. A better mush is made by using half milk and half
water. Serve hot or cold with cream, or milk, and sugar. If wanted for
frying, wet a pan in cold water, pour in the hot mush, and let cool.

flour may be mixed with the meal. When the mush becomes thick, place
in a steamer and steam six hours. Rinse a pan with cold water, pour in
the mush, smooth the top with hand or spoon wet in cold water, and let
stand in a cold place twelve hours. This is used for frying. Other
cereals may be used in the same way. The sliced mush should be dredged
in flour and cooked in salt pork, ham, or bacon fat in the spider, or
in lard or butter if it is to be served with syrup.

This can occasionally be found in city markets, and is a delicious

SALT FISH


With very, very few exceptions, fish and meats other than salt are not

many a dainty tidbit,--to make no invidious distinction,--and, for
some occult reason, the taste craves salt in the morning.

Roughly speaking, the recipes for salt fish are interchangeable. A
method of cooking recommended for one will be found equally good for
some of the others.

Salt fish left-overs may be used in hash, scrambles, omelets or
ramekin dishes, or reheated, rubbed to a paste, and served on toast,
with a poached egg on each slice.

pepper, and when smooth and thick add the cooked beef. A well-beaten
egg added just before taking from the fire is an improvement. Serve on
toast.


BACON AND EGGS

Have the bacon cut very thin. The colder it is, the better. Remove the
rind and cook in a hot frying-pan until crisp. Skim out the bacon,

a few moments before stringing. Serve on the skewers.


CRUMBED KIDNEYS

Parboil, drain, wipe, and split the kidneys, keeping them open with
skewers. Season with pepper and salt, brush with oil, roll in crumbs,
and broil, fry, or cook in a very hot oven. Make a sauce of melted
butter, lemon-juice, and minced parsley, and pour over them if
desired.


DEVILLED KIDNEYS

Parboil, drain, wipe, and slice the kidneys. Make a marinade of three
tablespoonfuls of olive-oil, one of vinegar,--tarragon vinegar or
lemon-juice may be used,--a teaspoonful of mustard, salt, and red
pepper. Dip the sliced kidneys in this dressing and broil. Minced
parsley is a pleasant addition to the marinade. After dipping in the
dressing, they may be rolled in crumbs and fried. Serve plain, or with
a sauce of melted butter, lemon-juice, and minced parsley, or with the
remaining marinade heated and poured over the kidneys.

which hard-boiled eggs, cut fine, and minced parsley are added. Serve
on toast.


BROILED KIDNEYS--MAÎTRE D'HÔTEL

Use veal or lamb kidneys. Plunge for an instant into boiling water,
skim out, and wipe dry. Split down the middle without cutting through,
skin, and run a skewer through each to keep flat. Broil as usual. When
brown, remove the skewers, lay on a hot platter, pour over melted
butter, add a squeeze of lemon-juice, and sprinkle with chopped
parsley. Kidneys and liver must be cooked very quickly, as long
cooking makes them tough.


MINCED LAMB WITH POACHED EGGS

Chop cold roast lamb very fine. Season with salt, pepper, and a bit of
mint. Reheat in the gravy, or in water, adding a little butter, or in
a cream sauce. Spread thinly on thin slices of dry buttered toast,
slip a poached egg on each slice, and serve at once, sprinkled with
pepper and minced parsley.

seasoned. Cool, shape into small flat cakes, dip in egg and crumbs,
and fry brown.


LIVER AND BACON BALLS

Cold cooked liver cut fine and half as much cooked bacon, chopped.
Shape into small flat cakes, using a raw egg to bind if necessary. Dip
in egg and crumbs and fry brown.


MEAT AND RICE BALLS

One cupful of cold cooked rice, one cupful of finely chopped cooked
meat,--any kind, or several kinds,--a pinch of salt, a dash of pepper,
two tablespoonfuls of butter, half a cupful of milk, and one egg. Put
the milk on to boil, add the rice, meat, and seasoning. When it boils,
add the egg, well beaten, and stir one minute. Take from the fire,
cool, form into small flat cakes, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry
brown. May be prepared the day before using.


FRIED SALT PORK

Cut in thin slices, freshen in cold water gradually brought to the
boil. Drain, wipe, trim off the rind, roll in flour, and fry. When
brown, put on a hot platter and make a cream sauce, using the fat in
the pan. Fried salt pork with cream sauce poured over it is a
venerable New England dish of some three centuries' standing.


PHILADELPHIA SCRAPPLE

Use the head, heart, and feet of fresh pork. Boil until the flesh
slips from the bone. Cool, take out the bones and gristle, and chop
the meat fine. Set aside the water in which the meat was cooked, and
when cold take the cake of fat from the surface. Bring the liquor to
the boil once more, add the chopped meat, and when at a galloping
boil, sprinkle in, slowly, enough corn-meal to make a thick mush. Cook
slowly for an hour or more. Pour into a pan wet with cold water and
let stand in a cold place over night. Turn out on a platter, cut in
half-inch slices, and fry.


SAUSAGE

Prick the skins with a needle or fork to prevent bursting. Cover with
boiling water, parboil five minutes, drain, wipe, and fry as usual.
The sausage meat is made into small flat cakes, dredged with flour and
fried. Bread crumbs may be used in making the sausage cakes if
desired. If the cakes do not hold together readily, add a little
beaten egg.


BAKED SAUSAGE

Prick the sausages and lay each one on a strip of buttered bread its
own length and width. Arrange in a baking-pan and bake in a very hot
oven till the sausages are brown and the bread crisp.


SAUSAGES BAKED IN POTATOES

Prick medium-sized sausages and brown quickly in a spider. Take out
and keep warm. Core large potatoes, draw the sausages through the
cores, and bake. A pleasant surprise for the person peeling the
potato.


BROILED SWEETBREADS

Parboil, in slightly acidulated water, for five minutes, then throw
into cold water. Remove pipes and fibres and let cool--the colder the
better. Split, rub with melted butter, season with pepper and salt,
and broil or fry. They may also be dipped in egg and crumbs and fried
or broiled. Serve on a hot platter. A sauce of melted butter,
lemon-juice, and minced parsley is a pleasing accompaniment.


FRIED TRIPE

Tripe as it comes from the market is already prepared. Wash
thoroughly, boil until tender, drain, and cool. Cut into strips,
season with salt and pepper, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry in butter
or drippings until brown. It may be prepared for frying the day before
and kept in a cool place. Breaded tripe may also be broiled on a
buttered gridiron.


FRICASSEED TRIPE

Cut a pound of tripe in narrow strips, add a cupful of water, a piece
of butter the size of an egg, and a tablespoonful of flour, rubbed
smooth in a little cold water. Season with salt and simmer thirty
minutes. Serve very hot, on toast if desired.


TRIPE À LA LYONNAISE

One pound of cooked tripe cut into inch squares, two tablespoonfuls of
butter, one tablespoonful of chopped onion, one tablespoonful of
vinegar, salt and pepper to taste. Put the butter and onion in a
frying-pan. When the onion turns yellow, add the tripe and seasoning,
boil up once more, and serve immediately, on toast.


TRIPE À LA POULETTE

Fry a chopped onion in three tablespoonfuls of butter. When brown, add
a pound of tripe, cut into dice, season with salt and paprika, and fry
until the mixture is partially dry. Add a heaping tablespoonful of
flour, and when the butter has absorbed it, add slowly two cupfuls of
stock or milk and a slight grating of nutmeg. Simmer till the tripe is
tender. Beat together one tablespoonful of melted butter and one
tablespoonful of lemon-juice, stir into the well-beaten yolks of two
eggs, take the tripe from the fire, mix thoroughly, and serve at once.


MINCED VEAL AND EGGS

Chop cold cooked veal very fine. Add hard-boiled eggs cut fine, one to
each two cupfuls of meat. Reheat in hot water, adding melted butter,
or in a cream sauce. A bit of green pepper, parsley, grated onion,
pimento, or capers finely cut may be used for flavoring. Other meats
may be prepared in the same way.




SUBSTITUTES FOR MEAT


Certain things are well suited to replace meat at the breakfast table.
It is a good idea to bar out the potato, unless in hash, for the
simple reason that the humble vegetable appears at dinner about three
hundred and sixty-five days in the year, and even a good thing may be
worked to death. Americans have been accused, not altogether unjustly,
of being "potato mad." Potato left-overs can be used at luncheon, if
not in hash for breakfast.


FRIED EGGPLANT

Slice the eggplant in slices one third of an inch thick, pare, put
into a deep dish, and cover with cold water well salted. Soak one
hour. Drain, wipe, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry brown.


BROILED MUSHROOMS

Choose large, firm mushrooms. Remove the stems, peel, wash, and wipe
dry. Rub with melted butter and broil. Serve with a sauce made of
melted butter, lemon-juice, and minced parsley.


FRIED MUSHROOMS

Prepare as above, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry in deep fat. Or sauté
in butter in the frying-pan. Breaded mushrooms may be broiled if
dipped in melted butter or oil before broiling.


BAKED MUSHROOMS

Prepare as above. Place in a shallow earthen baking-dish, hollow side
up, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and place a small piece of butter
on each. Baste with melted butter and a few drops of lemon-juice.
Serve very hot, on buttered toast.


GRILLED MUSHROOMS

Cut off the stalks, peel, and score lightly the under side of large,
firm, fresh mushrooms. Sprinkle with pepper and salt and soak a few
moments in oil. Drain and broil. Serve with lemon quarters and garnish
with parsley.


FRENCH TOAST

Make a batter of two eggs, well beaten, a cupful of milk, a
tablespoonful of melted butter, and spice or grated lemon- or
orange-peel to flavor. Dip the trimmed slices of bread in this batter
and fry brown in butter.


CORN OYSTERS

Two cupfuls of green corn, grated, half a cupful of milk, one cupful
of sifted flour, two eggs, a teaspoonful of salt and one tablespoonful
each of butter and lard. Beat the yolks of the eggs, add the milk,
then the flour and salt. Beat to a smooth batter, add the corn, then
beat again, adding the well beaten whites of the eggs last. Put the
lard and butter into a frying-pan, and when very hot put in the batter
by small spoonfuls. Brown on one side, then turn. If the batter is too
thick, add a little more milk. The thinner the batter, the more
delicate and tender the oysters will be. Canned corn may be used, if
it is chopped very fine, but it is not so good. By scoring deeply with
a sharp knife each row of kernels on an ear of corn, the pulp may be
pressed out with a knife. The corn may be cut from the cob and
chopped, but the better way is to press out the pulp.

       *       *       *       *       *

Regardless of the allurements of wood and field, it is always safest
to buy mushrooms at a reliable market. So many people are now making a
business of raising them that they are continually getting cheaper.
The silver spoon test is absolutely worthless. In fact, the only sure
test is the risky one: "Eat it, and if you live it's a mushroom--if
you die it's a toadstool." However, when buying mushrooms of a
reliable dealer, one takes practically no risk at all, and, even at
the highest price, a box of mushrooms is much cheaper than a really
nice funeral.




EGGS


Various rules have been given for testing the freshness of eggs, but
there is only one which is reliable, and it is, perhaps, the most
simple of all. It is merely this: open the egg and look at the
contents in a strong light. It is better to hold it near the eyes and
at the same time take a deep breath inward.

Strictly fresh eggs come from the country sometimes with the date of
their appearance stamped indelibly in purple on the egg. This is done
by giving the hens chopped calendars with their meals. Care should be
taken, however, to furnish this year's calendar. Nobody wants an egg
with a last-year's date on it and the error is likely to disarrange
the digestion of the hen. Eggs flavored with onions or tomatoes are
secured by turning the hens into a neighbor's vegetable garden. A
certain florist feeds his unsold roses to his hens and sells
rose-flavored eggs to his customers at a fancy price. The hint is well
worth remembering. Violet-flavored eggs might be had, doubtless, in
the same way.

At a formal breakfast, all precautions should be taken to insure the
freshness of the eggs. A conscientious hostess would be very much
mortified if she served chicken out of its proper course.


POACHED EGGS

Use a skillet, or muffin-rings placed in a pan of water, not too deep.
The water should barely cover the eggs. Bring the water to the boiling
point, drop in the eggs carefully, one at a time, and remove from the
fire immediately. Cover the pan and let stand until cooked. A
teaspoonful of lemon-juice or vinegar in the water will keep the
whites firm and preserve the shape of the eggs. Poached eggs are
usually served on thin slices of buttered toast. Take up with a
skimmer and let drain thoroughly before placing on the toast. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper. As every other writer who has given directions
for poaching eggs has said that "the beauty of a poached egg is for
the yolk to be seen blushing through the veiled white," the author of
this book will make no allusion to it.


SCRAMBLED EGGS

Put two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter into a frying-pan. When it
sizzles, break into it quickly six fresh eggs and mix thoroughly with
a silver spoon for two minutes without stopping. Season with salt and
pepper and a slight grating of nutmeg if desired. Scrambled eggs
should be thick and creamy.


SCRAMBLED EGGS--II

Beat the eggs thoroughly, add one teaspoonful of cold water or milk
for each egg and beat again. Cook as above.


SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH ASPARAGUS TIPS

Have one cupful of cold cooked asparagus tips ready. In boiling
asparagus its color will keep better if the smallest possible pinch of
baking soda be added to the water. It should be cooked quickly in an
uncovered saucepan. Prepare the eggs as for Scrambled Eggs--II, and
when they begin to thicken, put in the asparagus tips and stir until
the eggs are done. One half cupful of the asparagus tips to each three
eggs is about the right proportion, but more may be added if desired.
In making scrambles, allow one egg for each person and one extra for
each three persons.


SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH DRIED BEEF

One cupful of minced dried beef, which has been soaked in boiling
water for five minutes. Put it into melted butter, stir till the
butter sizzles, then pour over six or seven-well-beaten eggs. Stir
till the eggs are smooth and creamy. Serve at once. Any scramble may
be served on toast if desired.


FRIED EGGS

Three tablespoonfuls of butter in the frying-pan. When it sizzles,
slip in the broken eggs carefully, one at a time. Tip the pan and
baste with the melted butter while cooking. If wanted crisp on both
sides, turn the eggs over when the under side is done. Wet in cold
water the saucer on which an egg is broken and the egg will not stick
to it, but will slip easily into the pan. Olive oil may be used
instead of butter, but the pan must be covered during the cooking, as
the oil spatters.


FRIED EGGS AU BEURRE NOIR

Fry eggs as above, using butter or oil. When done, skim out, add more
butter or oil to that in the pan, season with salt, pepper, vinegar,
or lemon-juice, and let brown. When the butter is brown pour it over
the fried eggs and serve.


EGGS À LA CRÊME

Make a cream sauce, using one tablespoonful of butter, two of flour,
two cupfuls of milk, and pepper and salt to season. When the sauce is
thick and creamy, add hard-boiled eggs coarsely chopped, and serve at
once on toast. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.


EGGS À LA TRIPE

Fry two sliced onions in butter, but do not brown. Stir in one cupful
of milk or cream and enough flour to thicken, rubbed smooth in a
little of the cream or milk. Season with salt, white pepper, and a bit
of grated nutmeg. Stir till thick, then add eight hard-boiled eggs,
sliced crosswise. Heat thoroughly and serve.


EGGS AU MIROIR

Butter a stone platter that will stand the heat of the oven. Break
into it carefully enough fresh eggs to cover it, taking care not to
break the yolks. Place in the oven till the eggs are set. Sprinkle
with salt and pepper and minced parsley and serve at once.


EGGS WITH CREAMED CELERY

Make the cream sauce and put into it enough boiled celery, coarsely
cut, to serve as a vegetable. Spread on buttered toast and lay a
poached egg on each slice. The tough, unsightly portions of celery
stalks may be used in this way.


CHICKEN LIVER SCRAMBLE

Use one cupful of chopped cooked chicken livers and six or seven
well-beaten eggs. Prepare like other scrambles.


CHEESE SCRAMBLE

One half cupful of grated American cheese and six well-beaten eggs.
Mix the cheese with the eggs before cooking.


EGGS À LA PAYSANNE

Put one half cupful of cream into a baking-dish, break into it six
fresh eggs, and place in the oven till the eggs are set. Sprinkle with
salt and pepper, minced parsley, and sweet green pepper.

"left-over" which is otherwise hopeless may often be used
advantageously in a ramekin with an egg. The small individual dishes

OMELETS

    "_To make an omelet, you must first break eggs._"--_French
    Proverb._


So many different methods for making omelets are given, in works of
recognized authority, that it seems as if any one who had an egg and
an omelet pan could hardly go amiss. Yet failures are frequent, as
every omelet-maker knows.

French writers say positively that no liquid of any sort must be added
to an omelet--that it contains eggs and eggs alone, beaten just enough
to break the yolks. American authorities add milk or water, or beat
the eggs separately, the whites to a stiff froth. One of them makes a
clear distinction between an omelet and a puffy omelet; the puffy
omelet, of course, being made by folding in the stiffly beaten whites
before cooking. Some say milk makes it tough, and others say water
makes it stringy. Suffice it to say, however, that a perfect omelet is
a matter of experience and a deft hand. All writers agree that small
omelets are more easily made than large ones, and it is better to do
it twice or even three times than to have too many eggs in one
omelet. Below are given the various methods, from which the would-be
omelet-maker may choose. All of them have the stamp of good authority.


OMELET--I

Beat six eggs well, yolks and whites together. Put two tablespoonfuls
of butter into a frying-pan. When it is hot, pour in the beaten eggs,
which have been seasoned with salt and pepper. With a fork, draw the
cooked egg from the outside of the pan to the centre. As soon as it is
all thick, lift half of the omelet on to a plate, and turn the other
half over it. It should be turned while the centre is still soft, and
the fire should not be too hot.


OMELET--II

Break the eggs into a bowl, add as many tablespoonfuls of cold water
as there are eggs. Beat the eggs well, then season with salt and
pepper, and pour into a thin, smooth frying-pan which contains a
tablespoonful of melted butter. With a thin knife lift the cooked
portion of the egg and allow the uncooked portion to run down into the
butter, meanwhile gently rocking the pan back and forth. When creamy,
begin at the side of the pan nearest the handle and roll the omelet,
using a little butter if needed.


OMELET--III

Prepare as above, using milk instead of water.


OMELET--IV

Separate the whites and yolks of the eggs. Beat the yolks till thick
and lemon colored and the whites until they stand alone. Fold together
carefully, seasoning with salt and pepper, and adding a tablespoonful
of cold water for each egg. Have two tablespoonfuls of butter in the
frying-pan. When it is hot, pour in the egg mixture and let stand
until the egg is set around the edge and a knife plunged into the
centre comes out nearly clean. Then set the pan into the oven till the
omelet puffs. Score slightly across the middle with a sharp knife,
fold, and serve at once on a hot platter.


OMELET AUX FINES HERBES

Prepare Omelet I, and mix a tablespoonful of chopped parsley and
chives with the eggs before cooking.


PEA OMELET

Prepare Omelet I. As soon as the eggs are in the frying-pan, add a
cupful of cooked and drained peas, arranging carefully in the
outermost half so that the other portion will fold over it. Finish as
usual.


OMELET WITH ASPARAGUS TIPS

Have ready one cupful of cooked and drained asparagus tips. Prepare
according to directions given for Pea Omelet.


MUSHROOM OMELET

Use fresh mushrooms, if possible. Fry, and drain on brown paper. When
the eggs are in the frying-pan, spread the mushrooms on the outermost
half of the omelet, so that the other portion will fold over it.
Finish as usual.


OMELET WITH TOMATO SAUCE

Spread the outermost half of an omelet with tomato sauce, fold, and
finish as usual.


OMELET AU FROMAGE

Prepare Omelet I, adding half a cupful of grated Parmesan cheese, or
dried and grated American cheese, to the egg mixture.

omelet, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and fold.


DRIED BEEF OMELET

One cupful of dried beef, shredded or minced. Cook five minutes in
boiling water, drain in a cloth, spread on the outermost half of the
omelet, and fold.


KIDNEY OMELET

Cut the kidneys into inch pieces, fry, drain, and finish as for
Mushroom Omelet.

make half a cupful. Spread thinly on the outer half of an omelet, and
fold.


CHEESE OMELET II

Spread one cupful of grated cheese, Swiss, American, or Parmesan, on
the outer portion of an omelet when the eggs are first put in the
pan. Cook and fold as usual.

       *       *       *       *       *

Almost any left-over can be advantageously used in an omelet. Fish,
especially salt fish, meats, and vegetables, in quantities of half a
cupful or more, preserved and fresh fruits, cereals--everything but
soups, salads, and puddings. Roughly speaking, any omelet mixture can
be added to the eggs before cooking, but as a general rule, it is
better to spread it on half of the omelet and fold the other half over
it, as otherwise the omelet is more likely to be heavy.

Sweet omelets are delicious. A teaspoonful of powdered sugar should be
added to the eggs before cooking, and the fruit, jam, jelly, or
preserves should be very thinly spread, as flavor is desired, not a
dessert. Fresh fruits are cut fine and sprinkled with powdered sugar,
spread on half the omelet, and the other half folded over. In the case
of juicy fruits, such as oranges, the juice of the fruit is carefully
saved and poured over the folded omelet just before serving.

Among the fresh fruits suitable for omelets are Apricots, Bananas,
Blackberries, Cherries, Gooseberries, Grapefruit, Plums,
Huckleberries, Oranges, Pineapples, Peaches, Raspberries, and
Strawberries--all crushed very fine and sweetened; the juice, if any,
being poured over the omelet.

Among the stewed and preserved fruits are Apples, Apricots, Cherries,
Currants, Figs, Gooseberries, Peaches, Pears, Plums, Quinces, Rhubarb,
and the various fruit jams. Rum or brandy poured over the omelet and
set on fire just before serving is a pleasant addition to many of the
fruit omelets, Fig especially.




QUICK BREADS


People who can eat hot breads for breakfast are always sorry for those
who cannot. Quite often the internal dissension ascribed to the hot
bread is due to something else, or to an undesirable combination of
food elements in one and the same meal. Besides, hot bread is so good
that it is sometimes eaten too quickly. This hint is of medical origin
and is worth consideration. Almost any hot bread will be found
harmless when baked a second time.


BAKING POWDER BISCUIT

Four cupfuls of sifted flour, shortening the size of an egg,--equal
parts of butter and lard preferred,--two heaping teaspoonfuls of

baking-dish and bake till done. It should be like a baked custard and
is served from the dish with a spoon. Cereals other than rice may be
used, especially cerealine.


KENTUCKY BATTER BREAD

Two cupfuls of corn-meal, three eggs well beaten, one teaspoonful of

RAISED BREAKFAST BREADS


Although many recipes included in this section may seem, at first
glance, to be unsuitable for breakfast on account of the length of
time taken for rising, there are ways in which the time can be
considerably shortened.

A competent authority says that any mixture for rolls or muffins can
be made ready for its second rising at night, and kept over night in
any place where the dough will not freeze, or where the temperature is
not so high as to cause too rapid rising and consequent souring of the
dough.

Moreover, rolls or muffins may be baked in the afternoon until done
thoroughly, but not brown, wrapped in a cloth, and put away in a cool
place. In the morning, they need only to be rubbed with melted butter
and set into a hot oven for a very few moments. They will come out
crisp and flaky, and free from all objections on the score of
indigestibility. Bread twice baked is always much more digestible than
fresh bread.

Brioche, the most delicious of all hot breads, needs to stand in the
refrigerator over night, and the second process is a quick one when
the paste is once made. The paste will keep a week or more in a very
cold place, and be the better for it. It is a French dough, for which
many complicated recipes are given, but the following will be found
satisfactory, and not difficult after one or two trials.


BRIOCHE PASTE

One cake of compressed yeast, a pinch of salt, one and one fourth
cupfuls of butter, four cupfuls of flour, one tablespoonful of sugar,
two tablespoonfuls of warm water, and seven eggs. Dissolve the yeast
in the water, adding a little more water if necessary, and rubbing the
yeast cake with a spoon until thoroughly dissolved. Stir in enough
sifted flour to make a stiff dough, rolling and patting with the hands
until thoroughly mixed. Drop this ball of paste into a kettle of warm
water and let stand in a moderate temperature until it has a little
more than doubled in bulk. (Some recipes for Brioche say that the ball
of paste should be light enough to float.) Put the remainder of the
four cupfuls of flour into a mixing bowl, add the sugar, salt, and
butter, softened but not melted, and four of the eggs, unbeaten. With
the hand mix carefully to a paste, beat smooth, and add the rest of
the eggs, unbeaten, one at a time. Take the ball of paste, when
light, out of the warm water with a skimmer, and, still using the
hand, incorporate it carefully with the egg mixture, folding the two
together as lightly as possible. Let rise, in a moderate temperature,
until double in bulk. Then turn the paste on a floured board and pat
and fold with the hands until smooth in texture and inclined to stay
in shape. Let rise once more until very light, then put into the
refrigerator and let stand over night.


BRIOCHE ROLLS

Roll a large lump of Brioche dough into a thin sheet on a floured
board or pastry slab, working lightly and quickly, spread with
softened butter, and fold so that the paste will be in three layers.
Cut in strips an inch wide and twist, working from the ends, and
arrange in circles on a baking-sheet, the ends of the strips pointing
inward. The rolls should be very close together in the pan. Beat the
yolk of an egg, dilute it with as much milk, and brush the rolls with
the mixture. Let them rise a few minutes, then bake about half an hour
in a moderate oven. A little sugar and water may be spread over the
tops if desired.


BRIOCHE BUNS

Shape the chilled paste into small balls, and put a bit of citron or a
few raisins on the top of each one. Let rise a few moments and bake
half an hour in a moderate oven.


BRIOCHE BREAKFAST CAKE

Butter a round cake-tin which has a tube in the centre, fill it half
full of chilled Brioche paste, and let rise till the pan is two thirds
full. Bake in a moderate oven and turn out. It should be torn apart
with the fingers--not cut.


BATH BUNS

Dissolve a cake of yeast in two cupfuls of warm water. Add enough
flour to make a moderately stiff sponge, let rise about two hours.
Cream together one half cupful each of butter and sugar, add one
cupful of lukewarm milk, a pinch of salt, and two eggs, well beaten.
Mix with the sponge, let rise an hour longer, then knead, shape into
buns, arrange close together in a baking-pan, and let rise till very
light. Bake in a moderate oven.

    When his friends had told him that he gave them all a pain,
    Bath Bunny, Currant Bunny, sang it twice again._"

    Louis Wain.


ENGLISH BATH BUNS

Dissolve half a cake of compressed yeast in one cupful of milk, and
add two cupfuls of flour, or enough to make a sponge. Let rise until
light, then add two thirds of a cupful of melted butter and four eggs,
well beaten. Knead and let rise again for about an hour. Make into
balls the size of a small apple and press into each one some currants
and bits of candied peel. Let rise ten or fifteen minutes in a warm
place, sprinkle with sugar, and bake.


HOT CROSS BUNS

Rub one half cupful of butter into eight cupfuls of sifted flour, then
add half a cake of compressed yeast dissolved in three cupfuls of

sugar, one cupful of cleaned currants, and half a nutmeg grated.
Knead, shape into buns, arrange in pans, score deeply with a cross,
brush with butter, and let rise fifteen minutes. Bake forty-five
minutes in a brisk oven. This is the genuine English recipe, and the
buns are good at any time, but the cross is made only on Good Friday,
or for Easter.

place to rise. Add one tablespoonful of lard, one tablespoonful of
butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and one teaspoonful of salt to
two cupfuls of milk, and bring to the boil. Take from the fire and let
cool. When the sponge is light stir in the milk, and add enough sifted
flour to make a dough, usually about eight cupfuls, though the
thickening qualities of various brands of flour vary greatly. Knead
for fifteen or twenty minutes, then set to rise until very light.
Shape, place in a baking-pan, let rise once more, and when light bake
in a quick oven.


WHOLE WHEAT ROLLS

One teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sugar, one tablespoonful
of butter, one cake of compressed yeast, one cupful of scalded milk,
and three cupfuls of whole wheat flour. Add the salt, sugar, and
butter to the scalded milk. Dissolve the yeast in two tablespoonfuls
of warm water and add to the milk when it has cooled. Add half of the
flour and beat hard for ten minutes, then work in the rest of the
flour. Set it to rise for two hours. Roll out into a sheet an inch
thick and cut into small rolls. Place close together in a
well-buttered baking-pan, and let rise from fifteen to thirty minutes.
Bake fifteen or twenty minutes in a quick oven. Brush with an
egg-white beaten with a little milk if a glossy surface is desired.
This should be done about ten minutes before taking out of the oven.


SWEDISH ROLLS

Use any plain roll mixture. When shaping for the last rising, roll the
dough very thin, spread with softened butter, sprinkle with sugar and
cinnamon, and add a few cleaned currants, bits of citron, and stoned

teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of baking soda dissolved
in hot water, one tablespoonful of white sugar, and enough sifted
flour to make a soft dough. Let rise five hours. Roll out, shape into
balls, score each one deeply crosswise with a sharp knife, and arrange
close together in a well-buttered baking-pan. Let rise for an hour or
more and bake about half an hour. This recipe makes a large number of
rolls. They may be taken from the oven when beginning to turn brown
and wrapped in a cloth. Five minutes in a hot oven, if brushed first
with melted butter, will render them crisp, flaky, and very
digestible.

butter, one fourth of a cupful of sugar, and one unbeaten egg. Mix
thoroughly, and sift in enough more flour to make a smooth, elastic
dough. Shape into a loaf and let rise until very light. A Russian-iron
bread-pan holding one loaf is best for Zwieback. Let it rise once more
until very light, then bake in a quick oven. Glaze with sugar
dissolved in milk just before taking from the oven. When the loaf is
cold, cut in half-inch slices and place in an open oven until
golden-brown, dry, and crisp.




PANCAKES


The edible varieties of pancakes are readily distinguished from the
poisonous growths. The harmless ones are healthful and nutritious and
grow in private kitchens. The dark, soggy, leaden varieties are
usually to be found in restaurants, but have been known to flourish in
private kitchens also.

Batter for pancakes should be thoroughly beaten. A soapstone griddle
is best, but an iron one will do, and many a savory pancake has come
from a humble frying-pan. A pancake turner is essential, and no
pancake should be turned more than once, as twice turning makes a
soggy pancake from the most promising batter. In the following
recipes, where exact proportions are given, they are not arbitrary as
regards flour. The thickening properties of various brands of flour
vary so much that no exact rule can be given. A perfect pancake batter
will be smooth, light in texture, seem somewhat elastic to the touch
of the mixing spoon, and will keep its shape on a griddle. Batter
enough for one pancake should be dipped from the bowl with a cup or
large spoon, as adding uncooked batter to that on the griddle even an
instant after it has begun to cook will work disaster to the
pancake--and the hapless mortal who eats it.

Maple syrup is the syrup _par excellence_ for pancakes and waffles,
but alas, it is difficult to procure. Much of it is made from corn
cobs and molasses, sealed in tin cans bearing gaudy labels, and,
sailing under false colors, is sold to the trusting consumer at a high
price.

Even the bricks of maple sugar are not wholly trustworthy, though, as
a rule, a better quality of syrup can be obtained by making it at home
from the bricks. The ordinary adulterants cannot so readily be added
to a crystallized as to a liquid product, though promising maple
bricks are often made of brown sugar flavored with a little maple
syrup.

Other syrups can be made easily and may possibly give welcome variety
even to those fortunates who can secure the real maple syrup.
Maraschino, noyeau, kirsch, and other cordials, orange-flower water,
grated orange- and lemon-peel, and the fruit juices left from canned
and preserved fruits, can all be used to advantage in flavoring a
simple syrup made of sugar and water boiled till it hairs from the
spoon. Always add flavoring to syrup just before taking it from the
fire, and do not allow it to boil.

serve very hot.


FRENCH PANCAKES

One and one half cupfuls of flour, one and one half cupfuls of milk,
one teaspoonful each of salt and melted butter, two teaspoonfuls of
brandy, and four eggs. Beat the yolks of the eggs till light-colored
and creamy, add the other ingredients gradually and fold in the
stiffly beaten whites last. Fry in a very hot frying-pan, using equal
parts of lard and butter to fry in. Bake in small cakes, and after
taking up spread very thinly with marmalade, honey, or jam, and roll
up like a jelly roll. Sift powdered sugar over the rolls and serve at
once, without butter or syrup.


FEATHER PANCAKES

Scald two cupfuls of milk, dissolve in it one half cake of compressed
yeast, and add a teaspoonful of salt. Sift in enough flour to make a
thin, smooth batter, and set to rise over night. In the morning add
to it one cupful of thick sour milk, one tablespoonful of melted
butter, two eggs, beaten separately, one teaspoonful of soda sifted in
with enough flour to make a smooth, thin batter. Let stand twenty or
thirty minutes, then bake as usual.


FRUIT PANCAKES

Add apple sauce, berries, chopped dates, figs or prunes, orange
marmalade, chopped preserved quinces, or any desired fresh fruit or
preserves to any good pancake batter, in the proportion of one heaping
tablespoonful of fruit to each cupful of batter. The grated pineapple
which comes in cans is particularly satisfactory and needs no further
preparation. The fruit juice, sweetened, should be used instead of
syrup wherever possible.

till the dough leaves the sides of the bowl. Add a handful of
sultanas, half a cupful each of blanched and shredded almonds and
shredded citron, and, lastly, the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs.
Put into a tube-pan which has been well buttered, and set in a warm
place to rise. Bake very slowly. When fully risen and beginning to
brown, rub with softened butter, and sprinkle with sugar and spice.


VIENNA COFFEE CAKE

Dissolve a cake of compressed yeast in one cupful of scalded and
cooled milk, add a pinch of salt and one tablespoonful of brown sugar.
Sift one cupful of flour into a bowl, add the milk and yeast, beat to
a smooth, light batter, free from lumps, and set away in a warm place
till very light. Cream three quarters of a cupful each of butter and
powdered sugar, add four whole eggs, unbeaten, three unbeaten yolks,
and two cupfuls of sifted flour, working with the hand, and adding egg
and flour alternately. Incorporate gradually into the risen batter,
working thoroughly with the hand. Dredge half a cupful of blanched and
shredded almonds, a tablespoonful of shredded citron, and half a
cupful of cleaned and seeded raisins thoroughly with flour, and work
into the dough with the hand. Put into a buttered tube-pan or mould
and let rise in a warm place for three or four hours, then bake an
hour in a moderate oven. When beginning to brown, rub with softened
butter, sprinkle with granulated sugar and spice, and set back into
the oven until done. All risen coffee cakes will keep well if wrapped
closely in a cloth, and may be served cold, or reheated in a brisk
oven for a few minutes just before serving.


BERLIN COFFEE CAKE

Make a sponge with two cupfuls of milk, scalded and cooled, a cake of
compressed yeast dissolved in the milk, a pinch of salt, and one
cupful of sifted flour. Let rise two hours in a warm place, then add
one half cupful of melted butter, one cupful of cleaned and seeded
raisins, one fourth cupful of finely shredded citron, one cupful of
sugar, and three eggs, well beaten. Add enough sifted flour to make a
stiff dough, knead thoroughly, roll into a long thin strip, cut in
three strips, lengthwise, braid, and twist into a ring. Arrange in a
circle on a well-buttered baking-sheet and let rise till very light,
then bake half an hour. It will be more delicate if the strips are
rubbed with softened butter before braiding and will come apart more
easily. Before taking from the oven glaze with sugar and milk, or rub
with butter and sprinkle with sugar and spice.


QUICK COFFEE CAKE

Cream one fourth of a cupful of butter with one cupful of sugar, add
one egg, well beaten, one half cupful of milk, a pinch of salt, and
one and one half cupfuls of flour sifted, with a heaping teaspoonful
of baking powder. Spread in a pan, sprinkle with seeded and cleaned
raisins or currants, a little shredded citron, dot with butter, and
sift over sugar and spice, cinnamon preferred. Serve hot, cut in small
squares.


CRULLERS

Three eggs, a pinch of salt, two cupfuls of flour, three
tablespoonfuls of milk, six tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and six

circles or squares, let rise until very light, and fry in smoking-hot
fat. Let drain on brown paper and sprinkle with granulated sugar.


LIGHT DOUGHNUTS

Three quarters of a cupful of granulated sugar, two eggs, beaten
separately, one cupful of milk, three tablespoonfuls of melted butter,
three cupfuls of flour, three heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder,
and half a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg. Fold in the stiffly beaten
whites of the eggs last, then work in enough more sifted flour to make
a soft dough, probably about two cupfuls. Roll very thin, cut out,
fry in smoking-hot fat, and drain on brown paper. This recipe makes
about five dozen doughnuts, and half of it will be sufficient for an
ordinary family unless they are especially fond of doughnuts.


RAISED FRUIT DOUGHNUTS

Cream together one heaping tablespoonful of butter and one fourth
cupful of sugar. Dissolve one half a cake of compressed yeast in one

in two cupfuls of flour. Let rise until double in bulk. Mix together
one half cupful of sugar, a pinch of cinnamon, a grating of nutmeg,
and a pinch of allspice, one half cupful of cleaned currants, cleaned
and seeded raisins, and shredded citron, mixed, and a scant two
cupfuls of sifted flour. Lastly, add one egg, well beaten, knead
thoroughly, and let rise until very light. Cut or tear off pieces of
dough the size of an egg, drop into smoking-hot fat, and fry like
other doughnuts. Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with granulated
sugar.

Four cupfuls of milk, three eggs, beaten separately. Add the milk to
the yolks and a pinch of salt, then add one and one half
tablespoonfuls of rich cream or melted butter and sifted flour enough
to make the batter a little stiffer than pancake batter. Add the
whites of the eggs last, beaten to a stiff froth, and stir in quickly
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder.


GEORGIA WAFFLES

Two cupfuls of flour, a pinch of salt, two cupfuls of buttermilk, one
cupful of melted lard, one scant teaspoonful of soda, and one egg.
Sift the flour and salt together and beat into a smooth batter with
the buttermilk. Add the well-beaten egg, then the hot lard, beat
thoroughly, add the dry soda, beat hard for a minute or two, and bake
in hissing-hot waffle-irons.

just before baking, one heaping teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat
very hard for five minutes and bake in a hissing-hot iron.


MARYLAND WAFFLES

Beat four eggs separately, the whites to a stiff froth. To the beaten
yolks add a pinch of salt, two cupfuls of milk, and enough sifted
flour to make a stiff batter. Beat hard until perfectly smooth and
free from lumps. Thin the batter by adding gradually the beaten whites
of the eggs, and a little more milk in which a level teaspoonful of
baking powder has been dissolved. Add lastly one tablespoonful of
melted butter or lard. Have the waffle-irons very hot and well
greased, and butter each waffle as soon as done. Crisp light waffles
are delicious when served with cream and sifted maple-sugar.

BREAKFAST BEVERAGES


The breakfast beverage _par excellence_ is coffee, at least in
American households, but, rather than have coffee poorly made, it is
better to have no coffee at all. The French method of coffee making
has practically superseded the old-fashioned boiled coffee. Cheap
coffee, carefully made in the proper kind of a pot, has a better
flavor than the more expensive brands can possibly have when
improperly made.

The best coffee-pot on the market, which publishing ethics forbid us
to mention by name, is made of nickel, comes in five or six different
sizes, has a close fitting cover, a wooden handle, and has inside a
finely woven wire strainer, which does away entirely with the
questionable, and often unclean, cloth strainer. A cloth, no matter
how carefully kept, will eventually become saturated with the grounds,
and add the flavor of reheated coffee to the fresh brew in the pot.

The nickel coffee-pots having the wire strainer inside are easily kept
clean with boiling water alone, and about once a month may be boiled
out with a weak solution of baking soda.

Various blends of coffee have their champions, and the blended
package coffees are, in the main, very good. It is better to buy in
small quantities, a pound or two at a time, have the coffee pulverized
very finely at the grocery, and keep a watchful eye on the man while
he does it, lest he add alien elements to the coffee. Pulverized
coffee keeps perfectly in ordinary Mason jars, tightly sealed, if
bought in small quantities, as suggested.

The ideal coffee blend is two thirds Mandeheling Java and one third
Arabian Mocha, but very little genuine Mocha ever reaches this
country, though trusting consumers often pay high prices for what the
man says is sure-enough Mocha. Pure Java is easier to get, and South
American, Mexican, Cuban, and Porto Rican coffees are beginning to
deserve consideration.

Presuming that we have the pot and a good quality of coffee, finely
pulverized, we will proceed to brew the nectar of the gods. The water
must be fresh and captured while on its first boil. Scald the
coffee-pot, and put into it one heaping tablespoonful of pulverized
coffee for each person and another for the poor, neglected pot. If the
coffee is desired extra strong, put in another tablespoonful, or even
two. Pour in one cupful of boiling water for each tablespoonful of
coffee, keeping the pot over steam, but never over the fire itself.
Occasionally the grounds may be lifted from the bottom of the strainer
with a spoon in order to hasten the process a bit. The strength of
Samson may be given the brew by pouring out a cupful or two of the
coffee after it is made, and compelling it to go over the ground(s)
again.

Put the desired amount of sugar in each cup, and add a liberal
quantity of cream. Fill three fourths full with coffee and weaken
slightly with freshly boiling water. Coffee poured into cream and
afterward weakened with boiling water is an entirely different
beverage from that which results when the process is reversed. Anybody
knowing why, please write.

Never, never, never under any circumstances use the same coffee twice,
or add fresh coffee to the remnant in the pot, if by chance there
should ever be any left. Trim over last year's hat, if you must, and
buy no books for a year except this one, but do have the daily coffee
_right_.

Our deep feeling on this subject is caused by our own cherished
reputation for coffee making, which extends as much as three blocks in
every direction of the compass.


BOILED COFFEE

One cupful of ground coffee, mixed with a raw, unbeaten egg, and part
of the shell. Add half a cupful of cold water, and put it into the
coffee-pot. Pour over four cupfuls of boiling water, and as it rises
and begins to boil, stir it with a silver spoon. Let boil hard for ten
or fifteen minutes, then take from the fire. Pour out one cupful of
the coffee, then put it back, and set the pot on the back of the stove
for five minutes to settle.


CAFÉ GLACÉ

A welcome variant in summer, even for people who do not like cold
coffee. Fill iced-tea glasses three fourths full of inch cubes of ice,
add a lump or two of sugar, and pour in the coffee, boiling hot. Do
not stir, but add the cream immediately. For some strange reason, it
is better than if the hot coffee is poured over the ice, sugar, and
cream. Anybody knowing why, please write.


CHOCOLATE

Make exactly like cocoa, using milk instead of water. A few drops of
vanilla added to chocolate pleasantly accentuates its flavor.


COCOA

Directions are given on the package the cocoa comes in. If not, buy
another kind.


TEA

Cheap tea contains sawdust, dried and powdered hay, grass-seed, and
departed but unlamented insects. Moral--buy good tea, or go without.
Have the kettle boiling, and take the water at the first boil. Scald
out the tea-pot, which must never be of metal, and put into it one
teaspoonful of tea for each person, and one for the pot, or more, if
curly hair for the drinker is desired. Pour one cupful of boiling
water for each person and another for the pot upon the tea, and pour
off the tea inside of three minutes. After that the boiling water
busies itself in taking tannic acid out of the tea grounds. Tannic
acid hardens albumen into a leathery substance of which the most
courageous stomach is rightfully suspicious, and also puckers the
mucous membrane of the stomach into smocking. Persistent drinking of
boiled tea is quite likely to relieve the stomach altogether of its
valued and hard-worked mucous membrane.




SIMPLE SALADS


A salad with mayonnaise dressing is an ideal _pièce de résistance_ for
luncheon. It furnishes the necessary carbon in a light and easily
assimilated form, and, if well made, is always palatable.

Strictly speaking, there are but two salad dressings, French and
mayonnaise. The boiled dressing, with all its variations, is,
technically, a sauce. A true salad dressing is made almost entirely of
oil.

To make French dressing, put into a bowl or soup plate a pinch of
salt, a dash of red pepper, and three tablespoonfuls of olive-oil.
Stir with a silver spoon until thoroughly mixed, then add one
tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, and stir until thick. French
dressing must not be made until it is to be used, as it very quickly
wilts a vegetable salad. Four or five tablespoonfuls of oil may be
used to one of vinegar or lemon-juice if desired, and French dressing
may also be seasoned with tabasco sauce, Worcestershire, dry mustard,
celery salt, or any preferred condiment.

To make mayonnaise, put into an earthen bowl the yolk of a fresh egg
and a pinch of salt, a dash of red pepper and half a teaspoonful of
dry mustard. Place the bowl on ice or in ice water. Pour one cupful of
olive-oil into a small pitcher from which it will drop easily. When
the egg and seasoning are thoroughly mixed, begin to add the oil,
using a silver teaspoon, and rubbing rather than stirring. Add the oil
until a clear spot is formed upon the egg, then mix until smooth. Only
a few drops can be added at first, but the quantity may be gradually
increased. The clear spot upon the egg is an infallible test of the
right quantity of oil. If too much oil is added, the dressing will
curdle. A few drops of lemon-juice and long beating will usually make
it right again. If this fails, set the bowl directly on the ice in the
refrigerator, and let stand half an hour. If it is still curdled,
begin again with the yolk of another egg and add the curdled
mayonnaise by degrees to the new dressing.

When the mayonnaise is so thick that it is difficult to stir it, add
the juice of half a lemon, or more if desired. If wanted still
thinner, add a little cream at serving-time, but a stiff,
creamy-yellow mayonnaise is a culinary triumph.

With a little experience, mayonnaise is very quickly made. It need not
take more than ten or fifteen minutes to make enough abundantly to
serve six people. Packed in jelly glasses, and covered with wax paper,
or the cover of a jelly glass, mayonnaise will keep a week or more in
a cool place.

A quick mayonnaise can be made by putting into a bowl half a
teaspoonful of salt, a dash of red pepper, half a teaspoonful of dry
mustard, the yolk of an egg, four tablespoonfuls of olive-oil, one
tablespoonful of lemon-juice or tarragon vinegar, and beating all
together with the egg beater. If it fails to thicken, it is because
the egg is not strictly fresh, but even if it does not thicken, it is
palatable. A small jar of mayonnaise dressing, kept upon the ice, is
an ever present help in time of trouble.

All vegetables used for salads must be in prime condition. Lettuce
must be crisp, and only the perfect leaves used. Ragged edges may be
trimmed off with the scissors. The head lettuce is best for all
salads, but the leaf lettuce may be used if the other is not
obtainable. It is sometimes shredded into ribbons with a sharp knife
or scissors, but lettuce should be torn rather than cut, as cutting
breaks and bruises the fibres.

Salads with mayonnaise dressing are too rich to serve at dinner, and
hence are relegated to luncheons, Sunday-night suppers, and
hot-weather dinners, where no other meat is served.

The variety of salads is inexhaustible, and new combinations are
invented every day, many of them elaborate and very difficult to make.
The following salads, however, will be found simple, convenient, and
in every way satisfactory.

LUNCHEON BEVERAGES


Inasmuch as coffee usually appears both at breakfast and dinner, it is
well to bar it out absolutely from the luncheon table. Too much coffee
drinking is injurious, as the makers of imitation coffees assure us
daily through the medium of expensive advertisements. Though nothing
else is quite as good as coffee, yet there are many other beverages
which will prove acceptable at luncheon.


MILK

Serve from an earthen pitcher, either hot or cold as preferred.


BUTTERMILK

Buttermilk is always served ice cold. On a hot day a glass of
buttermilk, and a cracker or a bit of salted toast will often prove a
sufficient luncheon.


TEA

Use the best tea. The cheap tea is dear at any price. Scald out the
tea-pot, which should never be of metal, and put into it a
teaspoonful of tea for each person and one for the pot. Add as many
cupfuls of hot water as there are teaspoonfuls of tea. Cover and let
steep for a moment, but never allow it to boil. The water for tea must
be freshly boiled and taken at the first vigorous boil. When tea is
boiled, tannin is extracted from the grounds, and tannin, even in the
most minute quantities, has a very injurious effect upon the lining of
the stomach.


VIENNA CHOCOLATE

Three heaping tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate mixed to a paste with
cold water. Pour it into a double boiler with four cupfuls of milk
boiling hot. Add sugar to taste, and let cook five minutes. Beat the
whites of two eggs to a stiff froth and put into the chocolate pot.
Put a teaspoonful of vanilla into the chocolate after taking from the
fire, and pour the hot chocolate very slowly upon the eggs, stirring
constantly with a silver spoon or the wooden stick which comes for the
purpose. It makes a delicious, frothy chocolate. The cocoa which comes
in packages may be used instead of grated chocolate.


COCOA

Directions are given on the package the cocoa comes in. If not, buy
another kind next time.


LEMONADE

Select perfect lemons and roll until soft. Extract the juice, using a
glass lemon squeezer, and rejecting the seeds and pulp. Rub cut loaf
sugar over the peel of the lemon to extract the oil, and add to the
lemon-juice. Fill a glass pitcher one third full of broken ice, pour
the lemon-juice upon the ice, and add granulated sugar and water to
taste.


ICED TEA

Make tea according to directions given above, using two or three extra
teaspoonfuls of tea. Fill a glass pitcher half full of broken ice, and
pour the tea, scalding hot, upon the ice, being careful that the
stream strikes the ice, and not the pitcher. Serve with cut loaf
sugar, and slices of lemon.


PINEAPPLE CUP

Put into a bowl the juice of three lemons, two oranges, sliced and
seeded, one grated pineapple, and one cupful of sugar. Let stand an
hour to extract the juice, then strain through a fruit press. Add to
the juice as much cold water as desired, and two slices of pineapple,
shredded. Pour into glasses half full of cracked ice.


RASPBERRY CUP

Mash and strain two cupfuls of currants stripped from the stems. Mash
also an equal quantity of raspberries. Mix the juices, sweeten to
taste, and serve in glasses with cracked ice and cold water.


PINEAPPLE LEMONADE

One cupful of sugar, one cupful of canned pineapple, one cupful of
water and the juice of two lemons. Boil the sugar and water until it
threads. Put the pineapple through the fruit press and add to the
syrup with the juice of the lemons. When ready to serve, add water and
sugar to taste. Serve ice cold.


GRAPE JUICE

Stem ripe Concord grapes. Do not wash unless necessary. Cover with
cold water and put into a saucepan over a slow fire. Boil until the
grapes are in pieces, then strain through coarse cheese-cloth and
sweeten to taste. Serve in glasses with plenty of cracked ice.


BLACKBERRY SHRUB

For every cupful of fruit juice take one half cupful of cider vinegar
and two cupfuls of sugar. Put the fruit, sugar, and vinegar over the
fire, stir until the sugar dissolves, and boil until a thick syrup.
Skim if necessary, strain, and bottle. When served, allow one fourth
cupful of syrup to half or three fourths of a cupful of ice water.


RASPBERRY SHRUB

Use ripe red raspberries, and prepare according to directions given
for Blackberry Shrub.


RASPBERRY DASH

Fill the tumbler half full of cracked ice. Add one tablespoonful of
sweetened raspberry juice and one tablespoonful of cream. Fill the
glass with soda water.


MINT SANGAREE

Crush two or three sprays of mint with a lump of sugar. Put into a
glass half full of cracked ice. Add four tablespoonfuls of grape juice
and fill the glass to the brim with charged water. Shake thoroughly
and strain into another glass.


SELTZER LEMONADE

Squeeze the juice of a lemon into a tall glass, add two inches of
shaved ice, two heaping teaspoonfuls of sugar and fill the glass with
seltzer or Apollinaris.


TEMPERANCE PUNCH

Upon a tablespoonful of good tea pour two quarts of boiling water. In
the meantime have ready the juice and peelings of three lemons and one
orange in a pitcher. When the tea has steeped for five minutes, strain
through a fine strainer into the pitcher. Add a cupful of sugar and
cool slowly. At serving-time put into glasses with plenty of ice.




EATING AND DINING


There is an old saying to the effect that "all may eat, but ladies and
gentlemen dine." The difference lies more in the preparation and
manner of serving than in the food itself, and whether her evening
meal is a banquet or a repast of the lunch-counter sort rests wholly
with the housewife.

We pause long enough to pay our disrespects to that barbarous
institution known in America as the Sunday Dinner. On six days in the
week, the average business man eats a light luncheon or none at all.
On the seventh day, at an unaccustomed hour, he eats a heavy meal,
goes to sleep shortly afterward, and wonders why Monday is a "blue
day."

Our uncivilized Sundays are responsible for our Monday morning
headaches and for the gloom which, in many a household, does not wear
off until Tuesday morning. If Sunday were a day of fasting instead of
a day of feasting, Monday might be radiant occasionally instead of
riotous or revolutionary.

We make Sunday a hard day for the women of the household, especially
the servants, and the imperial liver appertaining to the Head of the
Establishment balks sometimes at the strain. The American Sunday
Dinner is one cause of the American Servant Problem--and everybody
knows what that is.

In more than one household, a twelve or one o'clock breakfast has
proved both hygienic and satisfactory. Coffee and rolls are served to
those who want them at eight or nine o'clock, if they come into the
dining-room. At noon the family sits down to a simple breakfast--fruit,
broiled chicken, creamed potatoes, hot bread and coffee, for example.
The maid has few dishes to wash, is not too tired to enjoy her
afternoon off, and gets away two or three hours earlier than her less
fortunate sisters. Also she remains where she is hired--which has its
advantages. Only a light lunch is needed in the evening which the
mistress may serve, leaving the dishes to be washed in the morning.

Owing to the aforesaid American Servant Problem an increasing number
of women do their own housework--not from choice, but from stern
necessity. This book is intended for the woman in a small house or
apartment, who is her own cook, who earnestly desires to do her duty
by her family, yet be something more than a wearied and soul-sickened
drudge; who has to look after her dimes and nickels, if not her
pennies, and who wants more than the weekly "afternoon off" accorded
to the stronger women who undertake domestic tasks.

Simplicity--and, as a general rule, economy--has been the standard by
which each recipe has been judged. All are within the capabilities of
the most inexperienced cook, who is willing to follow directions,
and, in the case of such variable materials as flour and eggs, trust,
now and then, to her own judgment.

FRENCH DRESSING FOR FRUIT SALADS

Prepare according to directions given for French dressing, using
lemon-juice or wine instead of vinegar and omitting the paprika.
Fruit-juice, claret, white wine, port, sherry, Madeira, Rhine wine,
and lime-juice are all used in dressing for fruit salads. If
additional seasoning is desired, add powdered cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger
or mace, or chopped candied fruits. For some salads sweet wine may be
used in the dressing.


MAYONNAISE

Put an earthen bowl into a larger one containing cracked ice. Break
into it the yolks of two fresh eggs, add a pinch each of salt and
paprika, and half a teaspoonful or more of dry mustard. Mix thoroughly
and add oil drop by drop at first. A clear spot forming upon the egg
is the test of the proper quantity of oil. Use a silver teaspoon for
mixing and beat constantly. If the Mayonnaise should curdle, put it on
the ice for an hour, or add a few drops of lemon-juice. When a cupful
or more of oil has been used and the dressing is stiff enough to cut
with a knife, add the juice of half a lemon, or more, according to
taste. Cover with paraffine paper and keep on ice until ready to
serve. For fruit salads, omit the mustard and pepper and at the last
fold in a little cream whipped solid. Veal or chicken jelly may also
be mixed with Mayonnaise. Chopped sweet herbs, pickles, olives,
capers, onions, garlic, shrimp paste, horseradish and caviare are used

water and a few grains of salt. Add the yolks of four eggs,
well-beaten, and the whites of two. Fry by tablespoonfuls in butter,
turning once, and sprinkling with sugar. Or, spread with jelly, roll
up, and sprinkle with powdered sugar.


STEWED PEARS WITH RICE

Peel, split, and core four large pears and cook until tender with two
cupfuls of claret and one cupful of sugar. Boil half a cupful of rice
until soft in milk to cover, sweetening and flavoring to taste. Spread
the rice in a serving-dish, arrange the pears upon it, reduce the
syrup by rapid boiling, pour over, and serve ice cold. Other fruits
may be used in the same way.


VANITIES

Beat two eggs very light, add a pinch of salt, and flour to roll. Roll
as thin as possible, cut into fancy shapes and fry brown in deep fat.
Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.


VIRGINIA PUFFS

Cream half a cupful of butter with a cupful of sugar, add the beaten
yolks of four eggs, a teaspoonful of vanilla, and sift in a cupful of
cornstarch and two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, alternating with the
stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in buttered gem-pans, hissing
hot, in a quick oven. Serve with any preferred sauce.

Transcriber's Note

Variable spelling is preserved as printed, e.g. cardamon, crême.

The recipe for Braised Flank Steak, on page 318, may have some text
missing following 'pour over,' as it is unclear as written. Since
it is impossible to determine what that text might be, it is preserved
as printed.

There seems to be a heading, _PUDDINGS_, missing from page 492,
immediately before the recipe for APPLE PUDDING. The omitted heading
has not been added.

There may be a heading missing from the beginning of page 516,
immediately before the recipe for APPLES À LA NINON. The preceding
pages covered tarts. From the index listings, it seems that page 516
is the start of a collection of 'miscellaneous' dessert recipes. The
omitted heading has not been added.

On page 535, the index lists simply 'Raspberry' for the recipe for
Raspberry tea-cake on page 467. This is preserved as printed.

Minor punctuation errors have been repaired.

For ease of searching, hyphenation and accent usage have been made
consistent where there was a prevalence of one form over another.
Otherwise, they are preserved as printed.

The following typographic errors have been repaired:

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
