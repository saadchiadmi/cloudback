MEMOIR OF HON. SAMUEL SEWALL,

CHIEF-JUSTICE OF THE PROVINCE OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY.


Samuel Sewall, son of Henry and Jane Sewall, was born at Bishop Stoke,
in Hampshire, England, March 28, 1652. The family to which he belonged
was ancient and respectable. His great-grandfather was a linen-draper
of the city of Coventry, "a prudent man, who acquired a great estate,"
and was more "than once chosen mayor of the city." His grandfather,
Henry Sewall, born in 1576, came to New England, lived in Newbury
and Rowley, Ms., and died about 1655. Samuel, the subject of this
memoir, was taught to read at Baddesly; and was afterwards sent to a
grammar-school at Rumsey, of which a Mr. Figes was master. In 1661, he
came to New England with his mother, his father having removed here
previously. He was immediately put under the instruction of Rev. Thomas
Parker of Newbury, with whom he continued six years, till his entrance
into Harvard College, in 1667. His first degree he received under
President Chauncy, in 1671.

It was his original intention to enter the Christian ministry; and with
a view to it, he studied divinity, commenced preaching, and received
encouragement to go to Woodbridge, N. J., and settle as a minister
among that people, who went from Newbury, where his father lived. But
his thoughts were probably diverted from the sacred profession by his
marriage connection, in consequence of which he came into possession of
great wealth, and the means of influence and usefulness in public life.
He was married, Feb. 28, 1676, by Gov. Bradstreet, to Hannah Hull,
daughter and sole heir of John Hull, Esq., a goldsmith and highly
respectable merchant in Boston, master of the mint for many years, and
one of the Assistants in 1683, the year in which he died.

Mr. Sewall was chosen one of the Assistants in 1684, '5, and '6,
when the Colony charter was annulled, and the ancient government was
superseded by a President and Council. In 1688, during the oppressive
administration of Sir Edmund Andros, when the titles of many to their
lands, and of his among others, were questioned and in danger of being
forfeited, he made a voyage to England. But on his return, in 1689,
Sir Edmund having withdrawn from the country, and the old Charter
government having been revived, he resumed his seat at the Board
of Assistants. In the Provincial charter, granted in 1692, he was
nominated to be of the Council; and afterwards, without interruption,
was annually chosen and sat at the Board until 1725, when being
elected, he declined serving; having survived more than seven years all
who were appointed with him to that office in the charter.

As one of the Assistants under the Colonial charter, Mr. Sewall was
also _ex officio_ a Judge of the Supreme Court. Soon after the arrival
of the Provincial charter in May, 1692, but before any courts of
justice had been established and organized under it, he was appointed
one of the Judges of a Special Court of Oyer and Terminer for the
trial of persons charged with witchcraft, William Stoughton, Esq.,
being Chief-Justice. It is well known, that at that time there was a
general persuasion, not only in New England, but in the mother country,
and throughout Europe, of the reality of those impious compacts with
Satan, into which persons guilty of witchcraft were supposed to have
entered, and of that diabolical power or influence, by which they were
believed to act.[A] This court especially was under the delusion; and
consequently _nineteen_ persons of the many who were indicted and
arraigned before it at Salem for this crime, were, at different times,
tried, condemned, and, in pursuance of its sentence, executed. In this
unhappy affair, the Judges proceeded with great caution, asking advice
of some of the wisest and best men in the community, and having the
countenance of rulers, ministers, and in general of all classes of men.
But the delusion was soon made manifest. Judge Sewall in particular was
convinced of his error, in the part which he had taken in the court of
trials; and often discovered deep regret and humiliation on account of
it. He notes particularly in his Journal of Dec. 24, 1696, on occasion
of his son Samuel's reciting to him in Latin a portion of Matthew xii,
"the 7th verse did awfully bring to mind the Salem Tragedie." And at
a public Fast, Jan. 14, 1697, in the order for which there was some
reference to the doings of that court of Oyer and Terminer, and when he
was under much affliction on account of the death of an infant daughter
and other troubles and crosses, he presented to Rev. Samuel Willard,
his minister, a "bill," which was read in the worshipping assembly; (he
standing up while Mr. Willard read it, and bowing in token of assent
when he had done;) in which, while with much delicacy he appears to
have studiously avoided saying any thing that might seem to implicate
the other judges, he acknowledged his own guilt in the decisions of
that court, asked the pardon of it both of God and man, and deprecated
the Divine judgments on account of his sin or the sin of any other
person, upon himself, his family, or the land.

But though he thus condemned himself for the part he had acted in the
trials at Salem, yet the public confidence did not appear to have been
shaken, either in him or the other Judges. For on the first appointment
of Judges of the Superior Court, under the Provincial charter, Dec. 6,
1692, Mr. Sewall was chosen one. The others were William Stoughton,
Chief-Justice, Thomas Danforth, John Richards, and Wait-Still Winthrop,
each of whom, excepting Mr. Danforth, had been members of the Court
of Oyer and Terminer. April 16, 1718, he was appointed to succeed
Wait-Still Winthrop as Chief-Justice of the Superior Court. And
although from various causes there were numerous changes in this court
in his day, yet he still retained his seat on the bench until 1728;
when, in consequence of his advanced years and increasing infirmities,
he resigned it; having survived more than ten years all those who had
been members of that court from the beginning, and having officiated in
this capacity under the Colonial and Provincial governments upwards of
forty years. At the same time, he also resigned his office of Judge of
Probate for the county of Suffolk, to which he had been appointed by
Lieut. Gov. Tailer, in 1715.

Chief-Justice Sewall was a man of distinguished piety. He feared God
from his youth, and apparently made it the main end of his life to
glorify the God of his fathers, by walking humbly and unblamably before
him. He was eminently a devout man; constant and exemplary in his
attendance on the worship of God, both in his family, and in the public
assembly. He was a most diligent hearer of the preaching of the gospel.
This is proved by his numerous manuscript volumes which still remain,
containing the texts and general outlines of sermons and lectures,
which he heard both at home and abroad. He would often devote a whole
day to fasting, reading the scriptures, and communion with God in
secret. On such occasions, he would be abundant in prayer not only for
himself, family, and near connections, but would also frequently pour
out his enlarged desires in copious intercessions, (minutely enumerated
in many instances in his Journal,) on behalf of the college; the civil
and religious interests of the town, province, and land in which he
dwelt; the aboriginal inhabitants and African slaves; the destruction
of papal tyranny, superstition, and usurpation; the universal extension
and establishment of Christ's kingdom.

He was a diligent student of the Scriptures, reading them in their
inspired originals; and was prayerfully solicitous not only to
receive and obey their instructions, but also, that the faith,
worship, and practice of the whole church of God should be in exact
conformity with them. The prophetic portions of the sacred volume he
read with an inquisitive mind, and held some opinions respecting the
events predicted in them, which would be considered singular at the
present day. Upon these and kindred topics, he took a deep interest
in conversing and corresponding with the Boston clergy generally,
and with such men abroad as the Rev. Messrs. Higginson and Noyes of
Salem, Wise of Ipswich, Torrey of Weymouth, Walter of Roxbury, and
Stoddard of Northampton; President Wadsworth of Harvard College, and
Rector Williams of Yale College; Gov. Saltonstall of Connecticut
and Gov. Burnet of New York, afterwards of Massachusetts; with most
of whom, remnants of his correspondence on these subjects are still
in existence. In 1697 he published a work which he dedicated to Sir
William Ashurst and Lieut. Gov. Stoughton, called "Phænomena Quædam
Apocalyptica," of which there was a second edition in 1727; and in
1713 another work styled "Proposals touching the Accomplishment of
Prophecies." Both of these productions of his pen were apparently much
read in his time, though they have now become obsolete.

Judge Sewall was warmly attached to that system of faith, and to those
forms of worship and government in the church, which were embraced
and practised by the Puritan settlers of New England. Occasionally
he employed his pen in their illustration and defence. And he was
strongly opposed to any innovations in doctrine, as well as jealous
of any ceremonies or usages in divine service, that savored of human
invention. Still he abhorred persecution, and exercised candor towards
those who differed from him in their modes of worship or discipline.

He possessed an ardent desire for the universal spread and obedient
reception of the gospel among mankind. He became particularly
interested in the spiritual condition of the aboriginal natives,
whom he believed, with the apostle Eliot, to be descendants of the
ten captive tribes of Israel. To encourage the praying Indians at
Natick, he occasionally met with them in their worship, and frequently
gave them pecuniary assistance. To those at Sandwich, he contributed
largely for building a meeting-house. And from Mather's Magnalia it
would seem, that for some Indian congregation he erected a house of
worship entirely at his own expense. Hence those Indians "prayed for
him under this character, 'He loveth our nation for he hath built us a
synagogue.'"

His zeal on behalf of the Indian natives being known, he was chosen
in 1699 one of the Commissioners of the Society in England for the
Propagation of the Gospel in New England and parts adjacent; and
shortly after, their Secretary and Treasurer.

His sympathy for the enslaved Africans was very great. In 1700 he
published a tract, entitled "The Selling of Joseph," in which he
advocated their rights. In writing to Judge Addington Davenport, just
before he sat on the trial of Samuel Smith of Sandwich, for killing
his negro, he uses the following language: "The poorest boys and girls
in this Province, such as are of the lowest condition, whether they
be English, or Indians, or Ethiopians; they have the same right to
religion and life, that the richest heirs have. And they who go about
to deprive them of this right attempt the bombarding of Heaven; and the
shells they throw will fall down on their own heads."

John Saffin, a judge of the same court with Judge Sewall, and a
slave-holder, printed an answer to "The Selling of Joseph," to which
Judge Sewall alludes in a letter to Rev. John Higginson of Salem, then
the oldest minister in the Province, and one of the most venerated
men in New England. The letter is dated April 13, 1706, and the
allusion is, "Amidst the frowns and hard words I have met with for this
undertaking, it is no small refreshment to me, that I have the learned,
reverend and aged Mr. Higginson for my abettor. By the interposition of
this breast work, I hope to carry on and manage this enterprise with
safety and success." In a letter to Henry Newman at London, afterwards
agent for the Province of New Hampshire, which accompanied a copy of
"The Selling of Joseph," he desires him to do something "towards taking
away this wicked practice of Slavery," expressing the opinion that
there would "be no progress in gospelling" until slavery was abolished.

Judge Sewall was a proficient in classical learning, and a friend of
learning and learned men. Such was the confidence in his wisdom and
discernment by the founders and Trustees of Yale College, that he was
employed by them in 1701, together with Hon. Isaac Addington, to draw
up statutes for the regulation of their infant seminary. And of Harvard
College, of which he was sometimes a Resident Fellow, and afterwards,
as a member of the Council, one of the Board of Overseers for many
years, he was a warm and steady friend and liberal benefactor.

In his judicial capacity, he was a person of distinguished integrity
and uprightness; administering the laws of the land with justice and
impartiality, mingled with clemency; a terror to evil doers, and a
praise to such as did well.

He was also a person of eminent humility and meekness, benevolence and
charity. His house was a seat of hospitality, ever open to all good
men. The learned found him an intelligent companion; the ministers of
the gospel a liberal patron and friend. He visited the fatherless and
widow in their affliction, and gave much alms to the needy, especially
to indigent ministers or their bereaved families. He distributed in
the course of the last year of his life four hundred copies of such
publications as Mitchel on the Glory of Heaven, Walter on the Holiness
of Heaven, Lee's Triumph of Mercy, Mather's Mighty Saviour, Mather's
Glory of Christ, Higginson's Legacy of Peace, Loring on the New
Birth, The Strait Gate, Faith and Fervency in Prayer, Gibbs's Sermon
to Little Children, as is particularly noted in his Almanac for that
year. His last illness was of about a month's continuance. He died in a
triumphant hope of immortal life and glory, on the morning of Jan. 1,
1729-30, in the seventy-eighth year of his age.

Judge Sewall was thrice married; 1. to Hannah Hull, daughter of Hon.
John Hull; 2. to widow Abigail Tilley; and 3. to widow Mary Gibbs, who
survived him. He had children by his first wife only; namely, seven
sons and seven daughters. Of these fourteen children only six lived
to mature age, and only three survived him. We purposely omit in this
article a further account of the family, as we intend to give in some
future No. of this work, a full Genealogical Memoir of the Sewall
Family.

Judge Sewall left numerous volumes of manuscripts, indicative of his
industry and attentive observation. Among them, beside several small
volumes of a miscellaneous character, are,

1. A Journal of occurrences, &c., from Dec., 1673, to July, 1677. This
was destroyed by a fire at Boston, in 1824; but a copy of it had been
previously taken, which yet remains.

2. Three volumes of Journals, from Feb., 1684-5, to Oct., 1729, within
three months of his death. Also, a small volume, being a Journal of his
voyage to England, &c., in 1688.

3. A Letter Book, containing copies of his letters to his
correspondents, and in some instances, of theirs to him; from Feb.,
1685-6, to Sept., 1729.

4. A Common Place Book in quarto, containing extracts from authors in
English and Latin on various subjects which he had read.

5. Five volumes in 12mo, containing sketches of sermons and lectures,
which he heard at home and abroad.

For most of the above facts, we are indebted to the Rev. Samuel Sewall
of Burlington, and the late John Farmer, Esq., of Concord, N. H.

FOOTNOTES:

[A] Lord Chief-Justice Hale was of this persuasion, and pronounced
sentence of death upon persons supposed to be in league with Satan.
A belief in witchcraft so prevailed in England as to hold in bondage
the best of men. Proof of this is found in the 72nd canon made by the
clerical convocation in 1603, and in the laws enacted against the
crime itself. Isaac Ambrose, in his Treatise on the New Birth, directs
persons seeking salvation to inquire, while searching out their sins,
whether they have not sometimes been guilty of witchcraft. The fact
of witchcraft was admitted by Lord Bacon and Mr. Addison. Dr. Johnson
more than inclined to the same side of the question; and Sir William
Blackstone quite frowns on opposers of this doctrine. These facts are
mentioned not to justify Mr. Sewall and his associates on the bench;
but to show the injustice of selecting them as peculiarly guilty. The
severe charges which have been brought against the people of Salem,
Gov. Winthrop, Dr. Cotton Mather, and others of this country, lie
equally against the most learned, pious, and eminent of mankind. This
belief was the _mania_ of the day.




LETTER OF THE FIRST CHIEF-JUSTICE SEWALL TO HIS SON, SAMUEL SEWALL,
ESQ., OF BROOKLINE, GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF HIS FAMILY.


                                           _Boston, April 21, 1720._

  DEAR SON,

    You have often desired, that I would give you some account of the
    family of which you are. And altho' I am much less ab'e to doe any
    thing of this nature now when I have been left of my dear Parents
    very near Twenty years, yet considering the longer I stay, the more
    unfit I shall be, take what I have to say as follows;

    Mr. Henry Sewall, my great Grandfather, was a Linen Draper in the
    City of Coventry in Great Britain. He acquired a great Estate, was
    a prudent Man, and was more than once chosen Mayor of the City.

    Mr. Henry Sewall, my Grandfather, was his eldest Son, who out of
    dislike to the English Hierarchy sent over his only Son, my Father,
    Mr. Henry Sewall, to New England in the year 1634, with Net Cattel
    and Provisions sutable for a new Plantation. Mr. Cotton would have
    had my Father settle at Boston; but in regard of his Cattel he
    chose to goe to Newbury, whither my Grandfather soon followed him.
    Where also my Grandfather Mr. Stephen Dummer and Alice his wife
    likewise dwelled under the Ministry of the Reverend Mr. Thomas
    Parker and Mr. James Noyes.

    On the 25th March, 1646, Richard Saltonstall, Esq. Grandfather
    of Gurdon Saltonstall, Esq. now Governour of Connecticut, joined
    together in Marriage my father Mr. Henry Sewall, and my Mother Mrs.
    Jane Dummer, eldest Child of Mr. Stephen Dummer aforesaid, and
    Alice his wife: my Father being then about 32, and my Mother about
    19 years of age.

    But the Climat being not agreeable to my Grandfather and
    Grandmother Dummer, (whose Maiden name was Archer) they returned
    to England the Winter following, and my Father with them, and
    dwelt awhile at Warwick, and afterwards removed to Hampshire. My
    Sister Hannah Tappin, their eldest Child, was born at Tunworth May
    10th, 1649. Baptised by Mr. Haskins. I was born at Bishop Stoke,
    March 28, 1652; so that the light of the Lord's Day was the first
    light that my Eyes saw, being born a little before day-break. I
    was baptised by Mr. Rashly, (sometime Member of the Old Church in
    Boston) in Stoke Church May 4th. 1652. Mr. Rashly first preached
    a Sermon, and then baptised me. After which an entertainment was
    made for him and many more. Some months after, my Father removed
    to Badesly, where my Brother John Sewall was born Oct. 10, 1654,
    and was baptised in my Father's House Nov. 22 by Mr. Henry Cox,
    Minister of Bishop Stoke. My brother Stephen Sewall was born at
    Badesly Aug. 19th, 1657, baptised in my father's house by the said
    Mr. Cox. * * * * * My Father had made one Voyage to New England to
    visit my Grandfather Mr. Henry Sewall. And in the year 1659, he
    went thither again; his rents at Newbury coming to very little when
    remitted to England. In my father's absence, October 25, 1659, my
    Sister Jane Gerrish was born at Badesly and was baptised by Mr. Cox
    at Bishop Stoke in the house of Mr. Boys.

    At this Badesly, by the merciful goodness of God, I was taught to
    read English. And afterwards was educated in the Grammar School at
    Rumsey of which Mr. Figes was Master.

    My Father sent for my Mother to come to him to New England. I
    remember being at Bishop Stoke and Badesly, April 23, 1661, the day
    of the Coronation of K Charles the 2d, the Thunder and Lightening
    of it. Quickly after my Mother went to Winchester with 5 small
    Children, Hannah, Samuel, John, Stephen and Jane; and John Nash
    and Mary Hobs her Servants; there to be in a readiness for the
    Pool Waggons. At this place her near Relations, especially my very
    worthy and pious Uncle Mr. Stephen Dummer took leave with Tears.
    Capt. Dummer of Swathling treated us with Raisins and Almonds. My
    Mother lodged in Pump-yard London, waiting for the going of the
    Ship, the prudent Mary, Capt. Isaac Woodgreen Commander. Went by
    water to Graves-End where the Ship lay. Took in Sheep at Dover.
    Passengers in the Ship at the same time were Major Brown, a young
    brisk Merchant, and a considerable Freighter, Mr. Gilbert and
    his wife, He was Minister at Topsfield; Madam Bradstreet [then
    Gardener] Mrs. Martha, Mr. Pitkins Sister, who died lately at
    Windsor, and many others. We were about eight weeks at Sea, where
    we had nothing to see but Water and the Sky; so that I began to
    fear I should never get to Shoar again; only I thought the Capt.
    and Mariners would not have ventured themselves if they had not
    hopes of getting to Land again. Capt. Woodgreen arrived here on
    Satterday. I was overjoyed to see Land again, especially being so
    near it as in the Narrows. 'Twas so late by that time we got to the
    Castle, that our men held a discourse with them whether they should
    fire or no, and reckoned 'twas agreed not to doe it. But presently
    after the Castle fired; which much displeased the Ship's Company;
    and then they fired. On the Lord's day my Mother kept aboard; but I
    went ashoar, the Boat grounded, and I was carried out in arms July
    6, 1661. My Mother lodg'd at Mr. Richard Collicott's. This week
    there was a publick Thanksgiving. My Father hastened to Boston and
    carried his Family to Newbury by Water in Mr. Lewis * * * Brother
    Tapan has told me our arrival there was upon Lecture-day which was
    Wednesday. Mr. Ordway carried me ashore in his Canoe. We sojourned
    at Mr. Titcomb's. My Father presently sent me to school to the
    Reverend and Excellent Mr. Thomas Parker, with whom I continued
    till my entrance into the College; being admitted by the very
    learned and pious Mr. Charles Chauncey.

    Sept. 3. 1662 Mother was brought to bed of Sister Anne, Mr. Joshua
    Moodey the Minister's Mother being her Midwife. Baptised by Mr.
    Parker.

    May 8. 1665 Sister Mehetabel was born: Baptised by Mr. Parker. She
    became wife to the midwife's Grandson Mr. William Moodey. Dorothy
    Sewall (now Northend) was born Oct. 29. 1668. Baptised by Mr.
    Parker.

    At this time the commencement was in August. In the year 1667
    my father brought me to be admitted, by which means I heard Mr.
    Richard Mather of Dorchester preach Mr. Wilson's Funeral Sermon.
    "_Your Fathers where are they?_" I was admitted by the very learned
    and pious Mr. Charles Chauncey, who gave me my first Degree in the
    year 1671. There were no Masters in that year. These Bachelours
    were the last Mr. Chauncey gave a degree to, for he died the
    February following.

    In July 1672, Dr. Hoar came over with his Lady and sojourned
    with your Grandfather Hull. He (Dr. Hoar) was my Aunt Quincey's
    Brother, and preached as an assistant, to the Rev. Mr Thomas
    Thacher at the South Church. The College quickly called him to be
    President. He was installed in the College Hall in December 1672.
    Gov. Bellingham lay dead in his House, and Dep. Gov. Leverett was
    the Chief Civil Magistrat present at that Solemnity. The March
    following Mrs. Bridget Hoar, now Cotton, was born in Cambridge. In
    1674 I took my 2d Degree, and Mrs. Hannah Hull, my dear Wife, your
    honoured Mother, was invited by the Dr. and his Lady to be with
    them a while at Cambridge. She saw me when I took my Degree and
    set her affection on me, tho' I knew nothing of it till after our
    Marriage; which was February 28th. 1675-6. Gov. Bradstreet married
    us in that we call the Old Hall; 'twas then all in one, a very
    large Room. As I remember, Madam Thacher and Madam Paige, with whom
    Gov. Bradstreet boarded, visited us the next day.

    On the 2d of April, 1677, it pleased God to favour us with the
    birth of your brother John Sewall, our first-born. In June 1678 you
    were born. Your brother lived till the September following, and
    then died. So that by the undeserved Goodness of God your Mother
    and I never were without a child after the 2d of April 1677.

    In the Fall 1678, I was seized with the Small Pocks and brought
    very near to death; so near that I was reported to be dead. But
    it pleased GOD of his Mercy to Recover me. Multitudes died, two
    of my special Friends; viz. Mr. John Noyes, and Ensign Benjamin
    Thirston, who both died while I lay sick: and Mr. William Dummer,
    Son of Jeremiah Dummer Esq., aged about 19 years. Presently after
    my Recovery, in December, Col. Townsend and I were bearers to Mr.
    Joseph Tappin, one of the most noted Shop-keepers in Boston.

    And now what shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits? The
    good Lord help me to walk humbly and Thankfully with Him all my
    days; and profit by Mercies and by Afflictions; that through Faith
    and Patience I may also in due time fully inherit the Promises. Let
    us incessantly pray for each other, that it may be so!

HISTORY OF THE PILGRIM SOCIETY,

WITH A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE EARLY SETTLEMENT OF PLYMOUTH COLONY.


As introductory to a notice of the Pilgrim Society, the narration of
a few facts in reference to the early settlement of New England may
be neither inappropriate nor uninteresting. It will serve also to
elucidate more fully the objects of the Society.

Religious persecution was the chief cause of the emigration of our
forefathers to this country. The memorable Reformation, effected
principally by the instrumentality of Luther and Calvin, appeared
in England in 1534, under Henry VIII. During its progress, in the
reigns of Mary, Elizabeth, and James I., those who were denominated
Puritans[B] were subjected to the most cruel oppression. Thousands
suffered martyrdom; many were banished; and others were doomed to
perpetual imprisonment.

Those Puritans who lived in the north of England were, on account of
their dispersed state, divided, in the year 1606, into two distinct
churches. With one of these was connected the celebrated John Robinson,
who afterwards became its minister. Persecuted for non-conformity to
the established church, he, with a part of his congregation, that they
might worship God according to the dictates of their consciences,
removed in 1607-8 to Amsterdam, in Holland, where religious toleration
was then sanctioned by law; and soon after, (in 1609,) they went to
Leyden, where they formed themselves into a church, according to the
pattern prescribed, as they supposed, by the word of God. In that
place they remained till their removal to America. "Their motives
for this," (their removal,) "were to preserve the morals of their
youth; to prevent them, through want of employment, from leaving their
parents and engaging in business unfriendly to religion; to avoid the
inconveniences of incorporating with the Dutch; to lay a foundation
for propagating the gospel in the remote parts of the world; and, by
separating from all the existing establishments in Europe, to form the
model of a pure church, free from the admixture of human additions."
What Lord Brougham, of England, has said of the North American colonies
in general, is most strictly and emphatically true of these individuals
in particular. "All idea of wealth or pleasure was out of the question.
The greater part of them viewed their emigration as taking up the
cross, and bounded their hopes of wealth to the gifts of the Spirit,
and their ambition to the desire of a kingdom beyond the grave. A set
of men more conscientious in their doings, or simple in their manners,
never founded any commonwealth."

Such were the reasons which induced the founders of New England to
leave all that was dear to them in England and Holland, and to remove
to these then inhospitable shores; reasons sufficient to affect the
minds, hearts, and conduct of some of the best men that ever lived.
Speaking of them, Governor Stoughton remarked, "God sifted a whole
nation that he might send choice grain over into this wilderness."

In accomplishing their object, "it was agreed by the English
congregation at Leyden, that some of their number should go to America
to make preparation for the rest. Mr. Robinson,[C] their minister, was
prevailed on to stay with the greater part at Leyden; Mr. Brewster,[D]
their elder, was to accompany the first adventurers, but these and
their brethren remaining in Holland were to continue to be one church,
and to receive each other to Christian communion without a formal
dismission, or testimonial. Several of the congregation sold their
estates and made a common bank, which, together with money received
from other adventurers, enabled them to purchase the Speedwell,[E] a
ship of sixty tons, and to hire in England the May Flower, a ship of
one hundred and eighty tons, for the intended enterprise."[F]

The following graphic description of the attachment of the Pilgrims to
each other, and of their pious views and feelings on the occasion of
their separation, is found in Morton's New England Memorial.

"Being prepared to depart, they had a solemn day of humiliation, the
pastor teaching a part of the day very profitably, and suitably to the
present occasion; the text of Scripture was Ezra viii:21. The rest
of the time was spent in pouring out of prayers unto the Lord, with
great fervency, mixed with abundance of tears.--When they came to the
place," (Delftshaven,) "they found the ship and all things ready; and
such of their friends as could not come with them, followed after them,
and sundry came from Amsterdam to see them shipped, and to take their
leave of them. One night was spent with little sleep with the most, but
with friendly entertainment, and Christian discourse, and other real
expressions of Christian love. The next day, the wind being fair, they
went on board, and their friends with them, where truly doleful was the
sight of that sad and mournful parting, to hear what sighs, and sobs,
and prayers did sound amongst them; what tears did gush from every eye,
and pithy speeches pierced each other's heart, that sundry of the Dutch
strangers, that stood on the quay as spectators, could not refrain from
tears: Yet comfortable and sweet it was, to see such lively and true
expressions of dear and unfeigned love.--Their reverend pastor falling
down on his knees, and they all with him, with watery cheeks, commended
them with most fervent prayers unto the Lord and his blessing; and
then with mutual embraces and many tears, they took their leave one of
another, which proved to be the last leave to many of them."

On the 6th of September, 1620, the adventurers sailed from Plymouth,
in the May Flower, and, on the 9th of November, they arrived, after
enduring a perilous voyage, in sight of Cape Cod. Having entered
the harbor, they, on the 11th day of the month, after prayer and
thanksgiving, subscribed a written instrument, by which they were made
a body politic. The covenant entered into was signed by _forty-one_
individuals, who, with their families, amounted to _one hundred and
one_ persons. Mr. John Carver was unanimously elected Governor of the
colony for one year.[G] Though these adventurers undertook their
enterprise under the authority and sanction of a royal charter, yet
they commenced their political existence as a republic. December 22,
1620, they disembarked and went on shore. The place where they landed,
called by the Indians Patuxet, they named Plymouth, after the town in
England from which they last sailed.

Such was the origin of the settlement of the Plymouth colony.

Sentiments of high respect for the principles and character of the
first settlers of New England have been cherished in every succeeding
generation of their descendants. They have been eager to reward their
inestimable service by commemorating their virtues and piety, and by
preserving a recollection of their sufferings, resolution, and noble
deeds, in so glorious a cause. In doing this they have been actuated by
the dictates of nature, reason, and gratitude.

On January 13, 1769, when the storm of British oppression was
gathering, and the time for open and decided resistance to the crown
was at hand, an association called the "Old Colony Club" was formed
at Plymouth, consisting of some of the principal men of that place
and vicinity; and on December 22, of that year, the "Landing of the
Forefathers" was first celebrated.[H] The Winslows, Watsons, and
Howlands were among those who were the most prominent. Major-General
John Winslow of Marshfield, who had been an eminent officer in the war
between England and France, in 1754-1762, General Peleg Wadsworth,
Colonel Gamaliel Bradford, and Hon. George Partridge of Duxbury, Hon.
William Sever and General John Thomas of Kingston, Colonel Alexander
Scammell, then a teacher of youth in Plymouth, and afterwards a
distinguished officer in the American Revolution, were original or
early members of the Society.

"In the year 1773 the Association was dissolved, in consequence of
conflicting opinions existing among its members, in relation to the
American Revolution," and two of the early members of the Club left the
country, from attachment to the British government.

The following gentlemen have delivered sermons or addresses, by the
request of the "Old Colony Club," or of the inhabitants of the town, or
of the members of some one of the religious societies, at the times of
the anniversary at Plymouth, on the 22nd of December. Edward Winslow,
Jr., Esq., Plymouth; Rev. Chandler Robbins, D. D., Plymouth; Rev.
Charles Turner, Duxbury; Rev. Gad Hitchcock, D. D., Pembroke; Rev.
Samuel Baldwin, Hanover; Rev. Sylvanus Conant, Middleborough; Rev.
Samuel West, D. D., Dartmouth; Rev. Timothy Hilliard, Barnstable; Rev.
William Shaw, D. D., Marshfield; Rev. Jonathan Moore, Rochester; Doct.
Zaccheus Bartlett, Plymouth; Hon. John Davis, LL. D., Boston; Rev. John
Allyne, D. D., Duxbury; Hon. John Quincy Adams, LL. D., Quincy; Rev.
John Thornton Kirkland, D. D., Cambridge; Rev. Jonathan Strong, D. D.,
Randolph; Rev. James Kendall, D. D., Plymouth; Alden Bradford, LL. D.,
Boston; Rev. Abiel Holmes, D. D., Cambridge; Rev. James Freeman, D. D.,
Boston; Rev. Adoniram Judson, Plymouth; Rev. Thaddeus Mason Harris, D.
D., Dorchester; Rev. Abiel Abbot, D. D., Beverly; Rev. John Elliot,
D. D., Boston; Rev. James Flint, D. D., Salem; Rev. Ezra Goodwin,
Sandwich; Rev. Horace Holley, LL. D., Boston; Hon. Wendell Davis,
Sandwich; and Hon. Francis Calley Gray, Boston.

As the "Old Colony Club" had for many years ceased to act as a society,
and had, in fact, ceased to exist, that the object of the annual
celebration of the "Landing of our Forefathers" might be better
accomplished, a society was formed, November 9, 1819, by the name of
the "Old Colony Pilgrim Society," and immediately went into operation.
The Hon. Joshua Thomas, William Jackson, and Nathaniel M. Davis,
Esqs., were chosen a committee on behalf of the Society, to petition
the General Court for an act of incorporation. On February 24, 1820,
the Society was incorporated and made a body politic, by the name of
the "Pilgrim Society." The design of the institution may in part be
learned from a clause in the first section of the act of incorporation,
which is, "to perpetuate the memory of the virtues, the enterprise, and
unparalleled sufferings of their ancestors."

The "Landing of our Forefathers" was first celebrated by the Pilgrim
Society, December 22, 1820, that being the completion of the second
century since the settlement of New England, or the landing of the
Pilgrims. This event, which, in a most important sense, gave existence
to the nation, with all that is valuable in its civil, literary, and
religious establishments, was observed that year with more than usual
solemnity and interest. The Hon. Daniel Webster delivered an address[I]
on the occasion, worthy of himself and the memory of those whose
character and sufferings he so eloquently portrayed. A large concourse
of people attended the celebration, and were escorted to the place of
public service by the Standish Guards, a military company so called in
honor of Capt. Miles Standish.[J]

There were present on the occasion, a delegation from the Massachusetts
Historical Society, and from the American Antiquarian Society. The
Hon. Judge Davis addressed the Pilgrim Society on behalf of the former
institution, and the Hon. Levi Lincoln on behalf of the latter.
The Rev. Dr. Kendall replied to the one, and Alden Bradford, Esq.,
replied to the other. The kindest sentiments and feelings universally
prevailed, and the occasion was one of great satisfaction and rejoicing.

The Pilgrim Society, as such, annually commemorates the day on which
our Forefathers landed at Plymouth. On some of these anniversaries,
addresses have been delivered; in 1820, by Hon. Daniel Webster; in
1824, by Hon. Edward Everett; in 1829, by Hon. William Sullivan;
in 1834, by Rev. George Washington Blagden; in 1835, by Hon. Peleg
Sprague; in 1837, by Rev. Robert B. Hall; in 1838, by Rev. Thomas
Bobbins, D. D.; and in 1845, by Joseph R. Chandler, Esq. Since 1820,
at the request of some religious society or association, the following
gentlemen have delivered addresses on these anniversary occasions,
though not specially before the Pilgrim Society; Rev. Richard S.
Storrs, D. D., Braintree; Rev. Lyman Beecher, D. D., Boston; Rev.
Samuel Green, Boston; Rev. Daniel Huntington, North Bridgewater; Rev.
Benjamin B. Wisner, D. D., Boston; Rev. John Codman, D. D., Dorchester;
Rev. Convers Francis, D. D., Watertown; Rev. Jonathan Bigelow,
Rochester; Rev. Samuel Barrett, Boston; Rev. William T. Torrey,
Plymouth; Rev. John Brazier, D. D., Salem; and Rev. Mark Hopkins, D.
D., Williamstown. In the addresses which have been delivered, the
principles, motives, intentions, and character of the Forefathers
have been exhibited and approved; the causes of their emigration, the
interposition of God in their behalf, and the glorious results which
have followed, have been glowingly described.

The Society erected in the year 1824 a monumental edifice; the
corner-stone of which was laid with appropriate solemnities, and in
an excavation made in it for the purpose, was deposited, with other
articles, a plate having the following inscription: "In grateful memory
of our Ancestors, who _exiled_ themselves from their native country,
for the sake of religion, and here successfully laid the foundation of
_Freedom_ and Empire, December 22, A. D. MDCXX., their descendants,
the Pilgrim Society, have raised this edifice, August XXXI. A. D.
MDCCCXXIV."

The edifice is built of unwrought split granite, and is seventy feet
in length by forty in width, and is two stories in height. It has a
handsome Doric portico in front, eight feet wide, supported by six
pillars sixteen feet high. The whole expense of the building and
its appurtenances was more than $15,000. Its location is pleasant
and presents a full view of the outer harbor of the town. The
principal hall is adorned by a magnificent painting, representing our
Forefathers. This picture, valued at $3,000, was a donation to the
Pilgrim Society by the artist, Henry Sargent, Esq., Boston. It is a
splendid representation of the Pilgrims at their arrival on these
western shores. Pilgrim Hall is the most suitable receptacle for it;
and Col. Sargent has exhibited a noble generosity in placing it within
its walls. The dimensions of the picture are sixteen feet by thirteen.
It contains several groups of individuals attired in the costume of
their day. 1. Governor Carver and his wife and children; 2. Governor
Bradford; 3. Governor Winslow; 4. Wife of Governor Winslow; 5. Mr.
William Brewster, the presiding Elder; 6. Capt. Miles Standish; 7. Mr.
William White and his child Peregrine; 8. Mr. Isaac Allerton and his
wife; 9. Mr. John Alden; 10. Mr. John Turner; 11. Mr. Stephen Hopkins,
his wife, and children; 12. Mr. Richard Warner; 13. Mr. Edward Tilley;
14. Mr. Samuel Fuller; 15. Wife of Capt. Standish; 16. Samoset, an
Indian Sagamore; 17. Mr. John Howland, of Governor Carver's family, who
married his daughter.

In the edifice there is a room set apart for a Library and a Cabinet of
curiosities. It is already supplied with a number of volumes and many
manuscripts of early date. It is desirable that a copy of all the works
published by the Pilgrims and their descendants should be deposited in
the Library.

"Among the antiquities in the Cabinet of the Pilgrim Society are the
following:

"A chair which belonged to Gov. Carver. The sword of Miles Standish,
presented by William S. Williams, Esq. A pewter dish which belonged to
Miles Standish, presented by the late Joseph Head, Esq. An iron pot
which belonged to Miles Standish, presented by the late John Watson,
Esq. A brass steelyard, owned by Thomas Southworth. A cane which
belonged to William White; presented by Hon. John Reed. A dressing-case
which belonged to William White. The gun-barrel with which King Philip
was killed, presented by Mr. John Cook of Kingston. The original letter
of King Philip to Gov. Prince, written in 1662. A china mug and leather
pocket-book which belonged to Thomas Clark. A piece of ingenious
embroidery, in a frame, executed by Lora Standish, a daughter of Miles
Standish; presented by Rev. Lucius Alden of East Bridgewater. Many
curiosities are still in the hands of individuals and families, which
might add much to the interest of Pilgrim Hall."

The following Portraits embellish Pilgrim Hall: "1. of Edward Winslow,
painted in London in 1651, copied from the original, by C. A. Foster.
2. of Josiah Winslow, the first native Governor of the Old Colony,
painted in London in 1651, copied from the original, by C. A. Foster.
3. of Gov. Josiah Winslow's wife, Penelope Pelham, copied from the
original, by C. A. Foster. 4. of General John Winslow, copied from the
original, by C. A. Foster. The portrait of Gov. Edward Winslow is the
only one preserved, of those individuals who came in the Mayflower. The
originals of these paintings belong to Isaac Winslow, Esq., of Boston,
and are now in the rooms of the Massachusetts Historical Society. 5.
A portrait of the Hon. Ephraim Spooner, presented by Thomas Davis,
Esq., of Boston. 6. A portrait of John Alden, Esq., of Middleborough,
who died in 1821, aged 102 years, who was the great-grandson of John
Alden, who came in the Mayflower; painted and presented by Cephas
Thompson, Esq. 7. A portrait of Hon. John Trumbull, presented by
Col. John Trumbull. This portrait was painted in 1781. The face was
executed by Mr. Stewart, and the other parts by Mr. Trumbull himself,
while a student with him. 8. A portrait of James Thacher, M. D., late
Librarian and Cabinet-Keeper of the Pilgrim Society. It was painted by
Mr. Frothingham, in January, 1841, by order of the Pilgrim Society,
pursuant to a vote expressing their sense of the valuable services he
had rendered, in promoting the objects of said society.[K]

"The Hall contains also a bust of Hon. Daniel Webster, presented by
James T. Hayward, Esq., of Boston; and the bust of Hon. John Adams,
presented by Samuel Nicholson, Esq."

For an account of "Forefathers' Rock" and the beautiful monument
erected by the Pilgrim Society for its preservation, we make the
following extract from Dr. Thacher's History of Plymouth.

"The inhabitants of the town," [1774] "animated by the glorious spirit
of liberty which pervaded the Province, and mindful of the precious
relic of our Forefathers, resolved to consecrate the Rock on which they
landed to the shrine of liberty. Col. Theophilus Colon and a large
number of the inhabitants assembled, with about twenty yoke of oxen,
for the purpose of its removal. The rock was elevated from its bed by
means of large screws; and in attempting to mount it on the carriage,
it split asunder, without any violence. As no one had observed a flaw,
the circumstance occasioned some surprise. It is not strange that some
of the patriots of the day should be disposed to indulge a little in
superstition, when in favor of their good cause. The separation of
the rock was construed to be ominous of a division of the British
Empire. The question was now to be decided whether both parts should be
removed, and being decided in the negative, the bottom part was dropped
again into its original bed, where it still remains, a few inches above
the surface of the earth, at the head of the wharf. The upper portion,
weighing many tons, was conveyed to the liberty-pole square, front of
the meeting-house, where, we believe, waved over it a flag with the
far-famed motto, 'Liberty or death.' This part of the rock was, on the
4th of July, 1834, removed to 'Pilgrim Hall,' and placed in front of
that edifice, under the charge of the Pilgrim Society. A procession was
formed on this occasion, and passed over Cole's hill, where lie the
ashes of those who died the first winter.

"A miniature representation of the Mayflower followed in the
procession, placed in a car decorated with flowers, and drawn by six
boys. The procession was preceded by the children of both sexes of the
several schools in town. On depositing the rock in front of the Hall,
a volley of small arms was fired over it by the Standish Guards, after
which, an appropriate address was delivered by Doct. Charles Cotton,
and the services were closed with a prayer by Rev. Dr. Kendall.

"It affords the highest satisfaction to announce, that the long desired
protection of the 'Forefathers' Rock' is at length completed; and
it may be pronounced a noble structure, serving the double purpose
of security to the rock and a monument to the Pilgrims. The fabric
was erected in June of the present year, [1835,] and consists of a
perfect ellipse, forty-one feet in perimeter, formed of wrought iron
bars, five feet high, resting on a base of hammered granite. The heads
of the perpendicular bars are harpoons and boat-hooks alternately.
The whole is embellished with emblematic figures of cast iron. The
base of the railing is studded with emblems of marine shells, placed
alternately reversed, having a striking effect. The upper part of the
railing is encircled with a wreath of iron castings, in imitation of
heraldry curtains, fringed with festoons; of these there are forty-one,
bearing the names in bass-relief of the forty-one Puritan fathers who
signed the memorable compact while in the cabin of the Mayflower, at
Cape Cod, in 1620. This valuable and interesting acquisition reflects
honor on all who have taken an interest in the undertaking. In the
original design by George W. Brimmer, Esq., ingenuity and correct
taste are displayed; and in all its parts, the work is executed with
much judgment and skill. The castings are executed in the most
improved style of the art. This appropriate memorial will last for
ages, and the names and story of the great founders of our nation
will be made familiar to the latest generation. This monument cost
four hundred dollars. The fund was obtained by subscription; Lieut.
Gov. Armstrong heading the paper, and Samuel T. Tisdale, Esq., of New
York, contributing one hundred dollars. The author of this work" (Dr.
Thacher,) "had the honor and satisfaction of being the active agent in
its execution."

This account of the Pilgrim Society we conclude, by expressing our
high commendation of its object. To be affected at the sufferings
of the Pilgrims of New England; to exercise gratitude for their
inestimable labors and sacrifices; to venerate their virtue and piety;
to revere their principles of religious and civil liberty; and to
hand down a suitable memorial of them to succeeding generations, is
at once the duty and privilege of their descendants. Most cordially
can we adopt the expressive language of President Dwight, in speaking
of our ancestors. "When I call to mind," says he, "the history of
their sufferings on both sides of the Atlantic, when I remember their
preëminent patience, their unspotted piety, their immovable fortitude,
their undaunted resolution, their love to each other, their justice
and humanity to the savages, and their freedom from all those stains
which elsewhere spotted the character, even of their companions in
affliction, I cannot but view them as illustrious brothers, claiming
the veneration and applause of all their posterity. By me the names of
Carver, Bradford, Cushman,[L] and Standish, will never be forgotten,
until I lose the power of recollection."

Our apology for appending so many notes to this historical notice is,
that they illustrate the character of the Pilgrims of New England
and the times in which they lived, and thus serve to accomplish the
object we have in view. For instance, a few sentences in the farewell
discourse of the Rev. Mr. Robinson, who was in an important sense the
Father of the Plymouth colony, show the cast of mind, the religious
faith, and the adherence to Protestant principles, of himself and of
his flock.[M]

The first Presidents of the Society were Hon. Joshua Thomas, John
Watson, Alden Bradford, LL. D., and Nathaniel M. Davis, Esqs.

The present officers are Charles H. Warren, _President_; William Davis,
_Vice-President_; Andrew L. Russell, _Recording Secretary_; Benjamin M.
Watson, _Corresponding Secretary_; William S. Russell, _Librarian and
Cabinet-Keeper_; Nathaniel M. Davis, John B. Thomas, Isaac L. Hedge,
William M. Jackson, Schuyler Sampson, Joseph Cushman of Plymouth, and
James T. Hayward and William Thomas of Boston, _Trustees_.

FOOTNOTES:

[B] The term _Puritan_ was originally a term of reproach, though now
one of commendation. Neal, in his History of the Puritans, speaks thus
of them: "If a man maintained his steady adherence to the doctrines of
Calvin and the Synod of Dort; if he kept the Sabbath and frequented
sermons; if he maintained family religion and would neither swear
nor be drunk, nor comply with the fashionable vices of the times, he
was called a _Puritan_." The Puritans arose in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. After the famous Act of Uniformity, or, as it is called, the
Bartholomew Act, passed by the English Parliament, in 1602, they were
called Non-conformists. Since that period they have been more generally
denominated Dissenters.

[C] The Rev. Mr. Robinson never came to New England as he intended; but
died at Leyden, March 1, 1625, in the fiftieth year of his age. His
widow and children afterwards came to Plymouth. Mr. Robinson received
a university education in England, and ranked among the first divines
of his age. Prince, the New England Annalist, in his Chronology, thus
speaks of him: "He was highly esteemed both by the city and university
of Leyden, for his learning, piety, moderation, and excellent
accomplishments. The magistrates, clergy, and scholars lamented his
death as a public loss."

[D] Mr. William Brewster was born in England, 1560, was educated at
the University of Cambridge, and became a zealous Puritan. He resided
in the north of England, and when the church was formed over which
the Rev. Messrs. Richard Cilfton and John Robinson were ordained as
pastors, the members met at his house on Lord's day for worship,
so long as they were permitted by the civil authorities. When the
church, with their pastors, on account of persecution, had removed
to Holland, Mr. Brewster was elected Ruling Elder. After the arrival
of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, he usually preached to them twice every
Sabbath for nine years, as they had no regular minister till Mr. Ralph
Smith was ordained their pastor, in 1629; but he never administered the
sacraments. He was a man in whom the church reposed the most unlimited
confidence in respect to all their spiritual affairs. For piety he was
eminent. For human as well as sacred literature, he had a great taste;
and at his death, which occurred April 16, 1644, being 83 years old,
he left a handsome library valued in that day at _forty-three_ pounds,
a catalogue of which is to be found in the colony records.--_Allen's
Biog. Dict._

[E] The ship Speedwell, commanded by Capt. Reynolds, proved leaky
and unfit for the voyage, and was discharged from service before the
Pilgrims left Plymouth. The whole company, therefore, which came over
to this country, were passengers in the May Flower.

[F] Holmes's American Annals.

[G] Governor Carver died greatly lamented on the 5th of April
following, having sustained the office of chief-magistrate but
four months and twenty-four days. "He was a man of great prudence,
integrity, and firmness of mind. He had a good estate in England, which
he spent in the migration to Holland and America. He was one of the
foremost in action, and bore a large share of suffering in the service
of the colony, who confided in him as its friend and father. Piety,
humility, and benevolence, were eminent trails in his character."--_Dr.
Belknap._

On the death of Governor Carver, although only thirty-two years
old, and confined at the time by sickness, Mr. William Bradford was
unanimously elected his successor, as Governor of the colony. He
conducted the affairs of the colony for the great part of the time, as
chief, and two or three years as second magistrate, with consummate
prudence and ability for a period of more than thirty-one years.--In
his youth, he embraced the doctrines which were taught by the venerable
Clifton, and afterwards by Robinson, and became one of their most
devoted followers. He applied himself with great diligence to the
study of the ancient languages, both Latin and Greek. Of the Hebrew
his knowledge was intimate, and the French and Dutch he spoke with
ease. He read much on subjects of history and philosophy. In theology
he was deeply versed, and few there were who could contend with him
successfully in a polemical dispute. He wrote considerably; the loss
of his valuable manuscript history of the colony to 1646, can never be
supplied.--_Dr. Thacher's History of Plymouth._

[H] The following dishes were served up for entertainment on the first
anniversary; and the account is here inserted as a matter of curiosity:
"1, a large baked Indian whortleberry pudding; 2, a dish of sauquetach
(succotash, corn and beans boiled together); 3, a dish of clams; 4, a
dish of oysters and a dish of cod fish; 5, a haunch of venison, roasted
by the first jack brought to the colony; 6, a dish of roasted sea
fowl; 7, a dish of frost fish and eels; 8, an apple pie; 9, a course
of cranberry tarts and cheese made in the Old Colony."--_Dr. Thacher's
History of Plymouth._

The following toasts were also given on the occasion:

1. To the memory of our brave and pious ancestors, the first settlers
of the Old Colony.

2. To the memory of John Carver and all the other worthy Governors of
the Old Colony.

3. To the memory of that pious man and faithful historian, Mr.
Secretary Morton.

4. To the memory of that brave man and good officer, Capt. Miles
Standish.

5. To the memory of Massasoit, our first and best friend, and ally of
the Natives.

6. To the memory of Mr. Robert Cushman, who preached the first sermon
in New England.

7. The union of the Old Colony and Massachusetts.

8. May every person be possessed of the same noble sentiments against
arbitrary power that our worthy ancestors were endowed with.

9. May every enemy to civil or religious liberty meet the same or a
worse fate than Archbishop Laud.

10. May the Colonies be speedily delivered from all the burthens and
oppressions they now labor under.

11. A speedy and lasting union between Great Britain and her Colonies.

12. Unanimity, prosperity, and happiness to the Colonies.--_Russell's
Guide to Plymouth._

[I] The address was published, and has passed through several editions,
and been a source of considerable income to the Society.

[J] It is said of Capt. Standish, He possessed much native talent, was
decided, ardent, resolute, and persevering, indifferent to danger, a
bold and hardy man, stern, austere, and unyielding; of exemplary piety,
and of incorruptible integrity; "an iron-nerved Puritan, who could hew
down forests and live on crumbs."

The Rev. John Thornton Kirkland, D. D., President of Harvard College,
and the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock, D. D., first President of Dartmouth
College, were descendants of Capt. Standish.

[K] Dr. Thacher was appointed Librarian and Cabinet-Keeper of the
Pilgrim Society at its first organization, and his indefatigable
efforts contributed largely to the promotion of its objects. The
following extract from the report of a Committee of the Society
indicates the sense entertained of his services. "The undersigned,
to whom was referred the report of Dr. James Thacher, respecting the
Iron Railing around the Forefathers' Rock, report that the Society are
indebted to Dr. Thacher for this beautiful and costly monument, which
while it secures the Pilgrim Rock from further depredation, records
for the benefit of posterity, the names of our fathers, and affords a
pleasing subject of contemplation to many strangers who visit us." Dr.
Thacher died May 23, 1811, aged 90--The two extracts above are taken
from the Guide to Plymouth.

[L] "On the 11th of November, [1621] Robert Cushman arrived at
Plymouth, in a ship from England, with thirty-five persons, destined to
remain in the Colony. By this arrival the Plymouth colonists received
a charter, procured for them by the adventurers in London, who had
been originally concerned with them in the enterprise; and they now
acknowledged the extraordinary blessing of Heaven, in directing their
course into this part of the country, where they had happily obtained
permission to possess and enjoy the territory under the authority of
the president and council for the affairs of New England."--_Holmes's
Annals._

The names of the thirty-five persons who came in the Fortune, (for
so the vessel was called,) are, Robert Cushman, William Hilton, John
Winslow, William Conner, John Adams, William Tench, John Cannon,
William Wright, Robert Hickes, Thomas Prence, (Prince,) afterwards
Governor, Stephen Dean, Moses Simonson, (Simons,) Philip De La Noye,
(Delano,) Edward Bompasse, (Bumpus and Bump,) Clement Brigges,
(Briggs,) James Steward, (Stewart,) William Pitts, William Palmer,
probably two in his family, Jonathan Brewster, Bennet Morgan, Thomas
Flavil and his son, Hugh Stacie, (Stacy,) William Beale, Thomas
Cushman, Austin Nicolas, (Nicholas,) Widow Foord, probably four in her
family, Thomas Morton, William Bassite, (Bassett), two probably in his
family.

Mr. Cushman was one of those who left England for the sake of religious
liberty, and settled at Leyden. In 1617 he was sent to England, with
Mr. Carver, the first governor of the Colony, to procure a grant of
lands in America, and in 1619 he was sent again, with Mr. Bradford,
second governor of the Colony, and obtained a patent. He set sail
with the first company in 1620, but the Speedwell proving leaky, he
was obliged to relinquish the voyage. He came, however, to Plymouth,
November 10, 1621, but remained there only one month, when he returned.
While preparing to remove to America, he died, 1626. He was a man
of activity and enterprise, talents and piety, and well versed in
the Scriptures. Though not a minister, yet, while at Plymouth, he
delivered a discourse in the form of a sermon "on the Sin and Danger of
Self-Love," which was the first sermon from New England, ever printed.
It was first published at London, 1622, then at Boston, 1724, and at
Plymouth, 1785. After his death, Mr. Cushman's family came to New
England. Many are their descendants in this country.--_Allen's Biog.
Dict._--_Farmer's Register._

[M] "Brethren," said he, "we are now quickly to part from one another,
and whether I may ever live to see your face on earth any more, the
God of heaven only knows; but whether the Lord hath appointed that or
not, I charge you before God and his blessed angels, that you follow
me no farther than you have seen me follow the Lord Jesus Christ. If
God reveal any thing to you by any other instrument of his, be as ready
to receive it as ever you were to receive any truth by my ministry;
for I am fully persuaded, I am very confident, that the Lord has more
truth yet to break forth out of his holy word. For my part, I cannot
sufficiently bewail the condition of the reformed churches, who are
come to a period in religion, and will go at present no farther than
the instruments of their reformation. The Lutherans cannot be drawn
to go beyond what Luther saw; whatever part of his will our good God
has revealed to Calvin, they will rather die than embrace it; and the
Calvinists, you see, stick fast where they were left by that great man
of God, who yet saw not all things.

"This is a misery much to be lamented, for though they were burning
and shining lights in their times, yet they penetrated not into the
whole counsel of God; but were they now living, would be as willing to
embrace further light, as that which they at first received. I beseech
you to remember that it is an article of your church covenant, that you
shall be ready to receive whatever truth shall be made known to you
from the written word of God. Remember that, and every other article of
your sacred covenant. But I must here withal exhort you to take heed
what you receive as truth. Examine it, consider it, and compare it
with other Scriptures of truth, before you receive it; for it is not
possible that the Christian world should come so lately out of such
thick antichristian darkness, and the perfection of knowledge should
break forth at once."

PASSENGERS OF THE GOLDEN HIND.

(The First Englishmen in North America.)

BY SAMUEL G. DRAKE, M. A.


    [The above engraving is an exact copy of an armed ship of the time
    of Queen Elizabeth, the original publication of which bears date
    1594, and is to be found in that rare old work on "Nauigation,
    lately collected out of the best _Moderne writers thereof by M.
    Blundinile, and by him_ reduced into such a plaine and orderly
    forme of teaching as euery man of a meane capacitie may easily
    vnderstand the same."

    It is doubtless a much better representation of the ships that
    transported our fathers to these shores than any hitherto given.]

It was long ago remarked that but for the voyages and expeditions of
SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, North America would have remained unsettled, if
not almost unknown, for many years, if not for ages. To those who are
familiar with the history of the state of Europe during the century in
which Elizabeth lived, no argument will be required to convince them of
the truth of that position.

An exception may be taken to the heading of our article, but we are
well aware of the voyages of the Cabots, of Ponce de Leon, and of
Verazzini; the former of whom it is said discovered Newfoundland,
and the latter ravaged some part of Florida; and that Verazzini, a
little later, was eaten by the Indians of North America. If we consult
history, popularly known as such, it will hardly appear that the Cabots
set foot on these shores, while what was done by the others tended only
to discourage voyages of discovery in this hemisphere.

It is the intention in this article to furnish as complete a list
of the persons who sailed upon the voyage with SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
round the world, as can be collected, after long and patient search
and investigation. That such a list or catalogue cannot fail to be
interesting at this day, we feel assured, for two reasons; first,
because they were probably the first Englishmen, (certainly the first
whose names we have,) who landed in North America; and secondly, many
of them bore names common amongst us, even to this time. Whether they
were the ancestors or connections of the ancestors of these, we leave
for the investigation of those who bear these names, or who may have
the curiosity and leisure to pursue the interesting inquiry.

A third reason might have been given why such a catalogue of names
should be made out, had we published earlier, but as a settlement of
the "Oregon Question" has taken place, no one will be likely to put in
a claim to any part of that territory by right of discovery made by his
ancestor; and hence an emigrant to that region has no other reason for
any interest he may take in the following names than any of us have on
this side of the Rocky Mountains. And instead of the ancient claim of
rights by discovery, the Oregonian must now console himself as well as
he can with this distich of our famous revolutionary poet, Freneau:

    For the time once was here, to the world be it known,
    That all a man sail'd by, or saw, was his own.

By the following list it will be seen that the largest number of
those who embarked in the voyage, continued during it, and that some
others did not; while of some it is uncertain whether they continued
in it, returned with Capt. Winter, were lost with Capt. Thomas, or are
otherwise to be accounted for.

DRAKE set sail from Plymouth, Nov. 15, 1577, and returned to the same
port Sept. 26, 1580.

The following is the last entry, in the only true and authentic journal
preserved of that voyage. It is entitled "THE WORLD Encompassed by SIR
FRANCIS DRAKE," &c., and was printed in a small quarto volume, with
this imprint, "LONDON, Printed for NICHOLAS BOVRNE, and are to be sold
at his shop at the _Royall Exchange_, 1628."

    "And the 26. of Sept. [1580 in the margin,] (which was Monday in
    the just and ordinary reckoning of those that had stayed at home in
    one place or countrie, but in our coputation was the Lord's day or
    Sonday) we safely with ioyfull minds and thankfvll hearts to God,
    arriued at Plimoth, the place of our first setting forth after we
    had spent 2. yeares 10. moneths and some few odde daies beside,
    in seeing the wonders of the Lord in the deep, in discouering
    so many admirable things, in going through with so many strange
    aduentures, in escaping out of so many dangers, and ouercomming so
    many difficulties in this our encompassing of this neather globe,
    and passing round about the world, which we haue related."

We now proceed with the proposed catalogue of names, in which we shall
study brevity.

  FRANCIS DRAKE, Admiral, or as that officer was then generally
    denominated, general, of the expedition, in the ship called the
    Pelican, which name she bore until she entered the South Sea, when
    it was changed to the GOLDEN HIND. He was born about 1537,[N] and
    died on board his ship near Porto Bello, Jan. 28, 1596.

  JOHN WINTER, Vice-Admiral, in the Elizabeth. He continued in the
    voyage till the passing of the Straits of Magellan, when a storm,
    which for its fury and duration, had never been known to him or his
    companions, made every heart quail but the Admiral's, and compelled
    him, for his own safety, as he contended, to forsake the voyage and
    return to England. How many returned with him, we have no means of
    knowing, at present.

  To form an estimate of the violence of the tempest which deprived
    Drake of all his ships but that in which he himself was, one must
    recur to the original Journal of the voyage before noticed. That
    the reader may have an idea of that curious work, and lest he may
    never see it, a short extract will here be introduced. The writer
    of the Journal was in the Admiral's ship, to which it applies.

    "For such was the present danger by forcing and continuall flawes,
    that we were rather to looke for present death then hope for any
    deliuery, if God almightie should not make the way for vs. The
    winds were such as if the bowels of the earth had set all at
    libertie; or as if all the clouds vnder heauen had beene called
    together, to lay their force vpon that one place: The seas,
    which by nature and of themselues are heauie, and of a weightie
    substance, were rowled vp from the depths, euen from the roots of
    the rockes, as if it had beene a scroll of parchment, which by the
    extremity of heate runneth together: and being aloft were carried
    in most strange manner and abundance, as feathers or drifts of
    snow, by the violence of the winds, to water the exceeding tops of
    high and loftie mountaines. Our anchors, as false friends in such
    a danger, gaue ouer their holdfast, and as if it had beene with
    horror of the thing, did shrinke downe to hide themselues in this
    miserable storme; committing the distressed ship and helpelesse men
    to the vncertaine and rowling seas, which tossed them, like a ball
    in a racket. In this case, to let fall more anchors would auaile
    vs nothing; for being driuen from our first place at anchoring,
    so vnmeasurable was the depth, that 500. fathome would fetch no
    ground: So that the violent storme without intermission; the
    impossibility to come to anchor; the want of opportunitie to spread
    any sayle; the most mad seas; the lee shores; the dangerous rocks;
    the contrary and most intolerable winds; the impossible passage
    out; the desperate tarrying there; and ineuitable perils on euery
    side, did lay before vs so small likelihood to escape present
    destruction, that if the speciall providence of God himselfe had
    not supported vs, we could neuer haue endured that wofull state:
    as being inuironed with most terrible and most fearfull judgements
    round about. For truly it was more likely that the mountaines
    should have beene rent in sunder, from the top to the bottome, and
    cast headlong into the sea, by these vnnatural winds, than that we,
    by any helpe or cunning of man, should free the life of any one
    amongst vs.

    "Notwithstanding, the same God of mercy which delivered _Ionas_
    out of the Whales belly, and heareth all those that call vpon him
    faithfully, in their distresse; looked downe from heauen, beheld
    our teares, and heard our humble petitions, ioyned with holy vowes.
    Euen God (whom not the winds and seas alone, but euen the diuels
    themselues and powers of hell obey) did so wonderfully free vs, and
    make our way open before vs, as it were by his holy Angels still
    guiding and conducting vs, that more then the affright and amaze of
    this estate, we received no part of damage in all the things that
    belonged vnto vs.

    "But escaping from these straites and miseries, as it were through
    the needles ey (that God might haue the greater glory in our
    deliuery) by the great and effectuall care and trauell of our
    Generall, the Lord's instrument therein; we could now no longer
    forbeare, but must needes finde some place of refuge, as well to
    provide water, wood, and other necessaries, as to comfort our men,
    thus worne and tired out, by so many and so long intollerable
    toyles: the like whereof, its to be supposed, no traveller hath
    felt, neither hath there ever beene, such a tempest (that any
    records make mention of) so violent, and of such continuance, since
    _Noahs_ flood; for as hath beene sayd, it lasted from September 7.
    to October 28, full 52 dayes."

Though this extract be long, we have given but the closing part of the
description of the storm. When we consider that it was winter in that
region, and the nature of those seas, the storm (of which we have heard
so much,) which overtook Columbus sinks into comparative insignificance.

We cannot close this lengthened digression, (if so it may be
considered,) without an extract from a Poem on the Death of Drake by
CHARLES FITZ-GEFFREY; who in the following passage seems to have had
the wild scenes of Terra del Fuego, in a dismal winter's night, vividly
before him:--

    "Huge mountain islands of congealed ice,
    Floating (like Delos) on the stormy main,
    Could not deter him from his enterprise,
    Nor blood congealing winter's freezing pain,
    Enforce him, coward like, turn back again:
      Valor in greatest danger shines most bright,
      As full-faced Phoebe in the darkest night."

  JOHN THOMAS, captain of the Marigold. He was lost with all his
    company, after the expedition had passed the Straits of Magellan,
    in the terrible tempest, just described, among the islands of Terra
    del Fuego.

  JOHN CHESTER, captain of the Swan. He probably continued throughout
    the voyage.

  THOMAS MOONE, captain of the Christopher. He was with Drake in his
    early voyages to South America, and seems always to have been with
    him and to have followed his fortunes as long as he lived, and to
    have died almost at the same time with his beloved commander; not
    however from disease like him, but by the hand of his enemy, being
    killed by the Spaniards.

  THOMAS DRAKE, the youngest brother of the Admiral. He does not appear
    to have been in any command at the outset of the voyage, but was
    soon after raised to the command of one of the ships. At this
    time he was probably about 18 years of age. He continued with his
    brother in most of his voyages afterwards, was with him in his last
    voyage, and in command of a ship. From him are descended the Drakes
    of Buckland, and of several other places in the south of Devonshire.

  FRANCIS FLETCHER, chaplain to the expedition. He kept a journal of
    the voyage, a copy of which in MS. is said still to be seen in the
    British Museum, and from which the account before mentioned is
    supposed to be principally made up.

  EDWARD CLIFFE, who sailed in Capt. Winter's ship, and returned with
    him. He left a good account of his voyage.

  JOHN DRAKE, who for being the first to discover a Spanish
    treasure-ship was rewarded by the Admiral with his gold chain,
    "which he usually wore." He does not appear to have been of the
    Admiral's immediate family, but was very probably a near relative.
    He was afterwards a captain in Fenton's disastrous expedition, was
    cast away in the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, fell into the hands
    of the Indians, thence into the hands of the Spaniards, and was not
    heard of after.

  HENRY DRAKE. Of his relationship to the Admiral we have no certain
    knowledge, nor are we _certain_ that he was one of the "great
    voyage." He was in the last voyage, was present when a cannon-shot
    from the castle of Porto Rico passed through Sir Francis's ship,
    while he with his principal officers were at supper, which shot
    struck his seat from under him, mortally wounding Capt. _Brute
    Browne_ and _Sir Nicholas Clifford_. "This," says Dr. Thomas
    Fuller, "I had from the mouth of HENRY DRAKE, ESQ., there present,
    my dear and worthy parishioner lately deceased."

  FRANCIS PRETTY. About this individual there has been of late much
    controversy; whether or not he was one of Drake's company, and if
    he was, whether he was the author of the "Famous Voyage," (as that
    around the world was styled,) first printed by Hakluyt, in 1589.
    We have not space here to go into an examination of that question,
    and shall only remark, that it is possible he may have been one of
    Drake's company. Some have made him a Frenchman; but that opinion
    we entirely reject. It is certain that he sailed with Cavendish,
    and wrote an account of his voyage. The two voyages of Drake and
    Cavendish were printed in connection, which may have given rise
    to an error. Dr. Twiss, in his late examination of the Oregon
    Question, has, to our mind, set the matter in a clear light.

  GEORGE FORTESCUE, probably a connection of Drake, and perhaps of the
    family of Bartholomew Fortescue, Esq., whose daughter Gertrude
    married Sir Bernard Drake of Ash. This George Fortescue left a
    MS. account of the voyage, or at least some part of it, as we are
    informed by Dr. Fuller. He was a captain under his old commander in
    the West Indies, in 1585, and died during that expedition.

  THOMAS DOUGHTY. One of those, who, if we can credit Herrera, went out
    as a gentleman, "to learn navigation" and naval warfare, without
    any particular office. He became mutinous before the fleet arrived
    on the coast of Brazil, and was finally tried, condemned, and
    executed on a small island in the harbor of Port St. Julian. "In
    the Island," says the writer of the voyage, "as we digged to burie
    this gentleman, we found a great grinding stone, broken in two
    parts, which wee tooke and set fast in the ground, the one part
    at the head, the other at the feet, building vp the middle space
    with other stones and turfes of earth, and engraved in the stones
    the names of the parties buried there, with the time of their
    departure, and a memoriall of our generalls name in Latine, that
    it might the better be vnderstood, by all that should come after
    vs." He was buried with Mr. Oliver, who had just been killed by the
    Indians.

  THOMAS HOOD, mentioned only in connection with the case of Doughty.

  THOMAS BLACOLER, afterwards in the expedition of Fenton. The name is
    spelt with variation. There are those bearing it now in New England.

  JOHN GRIPE. Perhaps a mistake for "John the Greek."

  LEONARD VICARY, who was an advocate for Doughty. The name of Vicary,
    though not common in New England, is to be met with, and has
    probably been known in Massachusetts since 1680. In that year,
    Seth, according to Farmer, was admitted a freeman of Hull; and he
    adds, "this name has been in New Hampshire within a few years."

  ---- CRANE, perhaps _Ralph_ Crane, who afterwards served with Fenton,
    in 1582.

  THOMAS CHESTER, also a witness in the case of Doughty.

  ROBERT WINTERLY.

  ---- OLIVER, the master-gunner in the fleet, killed by the
    Patagonians.

  THOMAS CUTTLE, belonging to the Admiral's ship, with the rank of
    captain.

  JOHN DOUGHTY, a younger brother of Thomas, who was executed.

  JOHN BROWN, a trumpeter, an evidence against Doughty.

  JOHN COOK. It is doubtful whether any one of the company bore this
    name, yet a MS. bearing it has been made use of in a collection of
    voyages, the whole purport of which seems to be an attempt to cast
    a stain on the proceedings of Drake in the case of Doughty. It is
    supposed to have been written by some one present in the fleet, and
    the name of the transcriber may have been taken for the author. A
    _John Conyers_ is mentioned by Mr. Barrow as "an annotator on" the
    original narrative, now in the British Museum.

  JOHN FRYE, who, with more courage than discretion, jumping on shore
    in Africa, was seized by the Moors and carried off. He finally
    returned to England.

  EDWARD BRIGHT, a chief accuser of Thomas Doughty.

  THOMAS GOOD, prominent in the case of Doughty.

  JOHN BREWER, one of the company who landed on the island of Mocha
    with the Admiral, and were attacked by the Indians. He received
    seventeen wounds, yet recovered, and sailed afterwards with
    Cavendish.

  HUGH SMITH, mentioned in connection with the affair of Doughty.

  RICHARD MINIVY, who was killed by the Spaniards near Cyppo, Dec. 19,
    1578.

  ROBERT WINTER. Perhaps the same called _Winterly_ in one account, and
    _Winterhie_ in another.

  PETER CARDER, who with seven others separated from the Admiral at
    the western mouth of the Straits of Magellan, during the tempest
    before mentioned. In an open boat they succeeded in repassing the
    Straits, coasted the continent to Brazil, through every variety of
    suffering, until Carder alone was left alive. He finally reached
    England after nine years' absence, and was admitted to the presence
    of Queen Elizabeth, who heard from his own mouth the tale of his
    adventures. Purchas got from him the account which we have, and
    which he published in "his Pilgrims."

  WILLIAM PITCHER, who was one of the companions of Carder, and lived
    to reach the coast of Brazil, where he died from drinking too
    freely of water, when near dead of thirst.

  JOHN AUDLEY, one of those who favored Doughty's mutinous conduct.

  ---- WARRALL, also deeply concerned in the mutiny.

  ULYSSES, probably an African, servant to Capt. Winter.

  ---- COBB, [Caube in the narratives] with Winter or Thomas.

  ---- CHARLES, also with Winter or Thomas, but once mentioned.

  ---- ANTHONY, also with Winter or Thomas, and but once mentioned.

  WILLIAM HAWKINS, perhaps a brother of Sir Richard Hawkins, and son of
    Sir John Hawkins, Kt. He was afterwards vice-admiral under Capt.
    Fenton, in the expedition of 1582.

  JOHN DEANE, a witness in the case of Doughty. Whether he continued
    throughout the voyage or not, is unknown.

  JOHN MARTYN, afterwards Capt. John Martyn or Martin of Plymouth, and
    son of---- Martin of Bridgetown near Totnes, who had male issue
    living there in 1620.

  THOMAS CLACKLEY, boatswain in the Admiral's ship.

  JOHN SARICOLD, one of the important evidences against Doughty.

  EMANUEL WATKYNS. His name, with Saricold's and several others, is
    signed to certain articles going to prove the guilt of Doughty.

  GEORGE CARY, a musician. The same probably called _Gregory Cary_, in
    the documents in Barrow's Worthies. He attested to the mutinous
    conduct of Doughty.

  HENRY SPINDELAY, gunner in Capt. Chester's ship.

  JAMES SYDYE, mentioned only in Doughty's case.

  WILLIAM SEAGE, mentioned only as above.

  JOHN DAVIS, whose name the great northern Strait will ever
    perpetuate, who was perhaps in Capt. Winter's ship, though we
    are not sure of the fact; but in 1595, he said he had then
    "thrice passed the Straits of Magellan," which renders it quite
    certain that he must have sailed with Drake in his voyage of
    circumnavigation, as there is no other way of accounting for his
    having "thrice passed those Straits."

Thus out of "164 able and sufficient men," we have about one third of
them by name; and from a passage in "Barrow's Naval Worthies" we are
led to hope, that "twenty-nine" other names will yet be recovered.
Should they come to our hand, we may at a future time make an article
respecting them also.[O]

"AN EXAMINATION OF THE QUAKERS BEFORE [THE] COURT OF ASSISTANTS, 8
SEPTEMBER, 1656."


[The following is an exact copy of the original minutes, made at the
examination of the Quakers, at the court in Boston above specified.
Hutchinson refers to the books of the Court in his account or notice of
this affair; but whatever may there be found to justify his remark that
the Quakers made "rude and contemptuous answers," no one will allow
that any thing of the kind was contained in these original minutes, to
justify any such conclusion. They are here presented to illustrate, as
far as they may, this dark page of our early history. This document
is the more important, as it appears to be one of the earliest, if
not _the_ earliest paper in relation to the proceedings against that
people. They came into New England in July preceding their apprehension
and trial, and were twelve in number. The issue of their examination
being matter of history, it will not be necessary to go into the
details here. The inquirer after truth may consult Hutchinson, Neal,
Hazard, Bishop, and others for them.]

REASONS FOR GENEALOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS.

[COMMUNICATED FOR THE REGISTER.]


Perhaps at no time since the settlement of our country, has the public
mind been so deeply interested in genealogical research as it is at
the present. There is now perceived among all classes, a growing
disposition to make inquiries respecting the past. The National and
State archives are compelled to surrender the treasures which for
centuries have been locked up in their musty embrace. On every side
individuals are to be found, who are ransacking the homesteads of their
fathers, to acquire materials for biography and to settle the questions
respecting their ancestors which inquisitiveness suggests.

Some of these individuals appear to be urged on by curiosity alone. If,
through their inquiries, they ascertain that they have descended from
an old and celebrated family, the discovered fact seems to repay them
for all the toil at the expense of which that fact may be brought to
light. To establish their claim to descent from some noted warrior of
the age of chivalry, or from some distinguished statesman of a later
date, they are willing, not only to spend laborious days and sleepless
nights, but their purses are open, and their gratitude is freely
expressed, to any one who shall furnish them with a link to perfect the
chain which may connect them with their supposed ancestors.

A family pride, either innate or acquired, leads other inquirers
to their task. It is the height of their ambition to be able to
trace their lineage to the first settlers of our country. To have
derived their existence from the noble band who left a home rendered
insupportable by religious persecution, and crossed the stormy Atlantic
in the frail Mayflower, is to them a source of the highest pleasure. In
their efforts to establish this derivation, facts of great importance
in the local history of our country have been elicited. These efforts
have given birth to most of our town histories, whereby materials,
invaluable to our future historiographers and biographers are preserved
from the ravages of time. These men in consequence of their researches
become the _nuclei_ of associations for historical, genealogical,
and biographical pursuits, which, here and there, are springing into
existence. These associations are awakening the mass of the people to
a sense of the importance of the objects for which they were formed.
Many young men, naturally enthusiastic in every thing they undertake,
have caught the spirit of antiquarian research. From them we have much
to hope. New modes of investigation may be projected, new plans for
arranging and preserving historical and genealogical discoveries may be
proposed, and new deductions from these discoveries may be made. Such
are some of the advantages which may be confidently predicted as the
result of these labors in the genealogical field.

Other inquirers are inclined to the study of genealogy from the
_argumentum ad pecuniam_. The vast amount of property which remains
in abeyance in the old world, has arrested their attention. Every
announcement of estates wanting heirs stimulates anew their
investigations; and the presiding genius of the age suggests to them
the possibility of finding themselves entitled to this unclaimed
property.

How important, then, that a genealogical record should exist, wherein
the heirs of families should have a permanent place! How many bitter
controversies respecting heirship would thereby be prevented! How many
fraudulent distributions of property would thus be defeated! How many
of those who have been rendered destitute by the deceptions of false
claimants, would be restored to their legal rights, if such a record
had been hitherto properly kept!

The disputes of heirs relative to the distribution of estates have
frequently occasioned difficulty in our civil courts. In some cases
property has been carried to collateral heirs, because lineal
descendants could not sufficiently prove their derivation, and in other
cases, those who would have inherited at law as the representatives of
a deceased parent, are excluded by the intrigues of living co-heirs.
Frauds, as the reports of our courts attest, have been perpetrated
by those, who, from a similarity of name, though unrelated, have
emboldened themselves to step in and exclude others who were legally
entitled to the property, but who were unable to furnish sufficient
evidence to establish their claim.

The steamers from England often bring news of the extinguishment of
European resident heirs to estates in that country; and much money
has been expended in the research of ancestry, by our own citizens,
who have imagined themselves to be the true heirs to this property.
The families, from which the greater number of these estates descend,
are old families; branches of which came to this country prior to
the commencement of the eighteenth century, and the trans-atlantic
branch of the stock has run out. When this is the case, it is of high
importance that the American descendants of these families should be
able, clearly and conclusively, to prove their derivation. In this
view, is it not a matter of surprise, that until the present year,
the publication of a journal which could furnish information of so
important a character as that which now demands so great a share of the
public attention, has been delayed?

A Register which shall contain "Biographical Memoirs, Sketches,
and Notices of persons who came to North America, especially to
New England, before Anno Domini 1700; showing from what places in
Europe they came, their Families there, and their descendants in this
country;" which shall give "full and minute Genealogical Memoirs and
Tables, showing the lineage and descent of Families, from the earliest
dates to which they can be authentically traced down to the present
time, with their branches and connections," cannot but be invaluable.
If properly conducted, if the severest scrutiny is exercised by the
writers over the materials which come under their notice, in the
preparation of genealogical articles, the Register will become an
authority in our courts, and will save immense amounts of money to
the large number of individuals, who are attempting to trace their
descent from European families. The policy of the law which invests,
first, lineal descendants with intestate estates, and in the absence
of lineal descendants, carries the estates to collateral heirs, in
preference to an escheat to the State, is generally admitted. Were it
not so, one great incentive to industry would be destroyed. The desire
of securing their offspring against want, is a prevalent characteristic
of New England parents. Assiduity and energy in the pursuit of wealth,
which have overcome so many obstacles in our inhospitable climate,
have their origin in the desire to advance the interests of posterity.
How desirable, then, in order to carry out these views, does the
Genealogical Register become! Such a publication affords the only
permanent depository for such records as will serve to insure the
correct distribution of the property of deceased persons; and no parent
who wishes the avails of his labors to be transmitted to his remote
descendants can fail to perceive the utility of such a work, or can
decline to furnish such information for its columns, as will enable
those who come after him to prove their descent.

The frauds continually practised by those who assume to be heirs to
every unclaimed estate, have become a matter of notoriety in English
legal practice; and though there are many estates now in abeyance in
England for want of discovered legal heirs, the bar and the bench
in England are exceedingly distrustful of the evidence forwarded
by claimants in this country. No doubt many of these claimants are
sincere in the belief that they are true heirs to those estates;
but the evidence upon which that belief is founded generally proves
to be of too unsatisfactory a character to procure a judgment of
the English tribunals in their favor; whereas, had materials been
previously collected and given to the world through the columns of an
authoritative periodical, the evidence thus furnished would be almost
irresistible to any court of law.

We can ask with confidence the attention of all travellers to this
journal. Communications relative to the antiquities of the countries
they may visit; descriptions of monuments which exist, with the
inscriptions thereon; and such information as they may communicate
respecting themselves which may be interesting to the families to
which they belong: all these will be within the scope of this work.
It needs but an announcement of these facts, to obtain from those
interested, communications which will not only throw light upon the
pedigree of families, but will contain many accounts interesting to
genealogists, biographers, and historians, which otherwise would be
swept into oblivion; and in this department of the periodical, the
public will find amusing, entertaining, and instructive pages. In this
view of it, the New England Historical and Genealogical Register should
be extensively patronized; and we are happy to learn that thus far it
meets with the decided approbation of the community.




OUR ANCESTORS.


"Our ancestors, though not perfect and infallible in all respects, were
a religious, brave, and virtuous set of men, whose love of liberty,
civil and religious, brought them from their native land into the
American deserts."--_Rev. Dr. Mayhew's Election Sermon_, 1754.

       *       *       *       *       *

"To let the memory of these men die is injurious to posterity; by
depriving them of what might contribute to promote their steadiness
to their principles, under hardships and severities."--_Rev. Dr. E.
Calamy's Preface to his Account of Ejected Ministers._

NOTES.

EXETER. The settlement of Exeter commenced in 1638. The founder and
first minister of the place was the _Rev. John Wheelwright_, mentioned
by Dr. Belknap as "a gentleman of learning, piety, and zeal." He came
from Lincolnshire, England, and landed at Boston, Ms., May 26, 1636.
"He and Mary, his wife, were admitted to the Boston church, on the
12th of June." A settlement had been made, as early as 1625, at Mount
Wollaston, afterwards Braintree, Ms. In 1634, Boston was enlarged,
so as to include Mount Wollaston. Mr. Wheelwright became preacher to
the people at that place. These circumstances account for his being
mentioned in some publications, as having removed to New Hampshire
from Braintree; and in others from the church in Boston. Antinomian
sentiments were imputed to Mr. Wheelwright. He was a brother of the
famous Mrs. Ann Hutchinson, whose Antinomian zeal brought her into
public notice. At a Fast in Boston, in December, 1636, Mr. Wheelwright
preached one of the sermons. It gave offence, as it was judged to
reflect on ministers and magistrates. He was said to have asserted,
"that they walked in such a way of salvation as was no better than a
covenant of works:" and also, that "he exhorted such as were under a
covenant of grace to combat them, as their greatest enemies." [_Neal's
New Eng._, Vol. I. p. 186.]

Mr. Wheelwright was summoned, by the civil court, "to give in his
answer explicitly, whether he would acknowledge his offence, in
preaching his late seditious sermon, or abide the sentence of the
court." His answer was, "that he had been guilty of no sedition nor
contempt; that he had delivered nothing but the truth of Christ; and,
for the application of his doctrine, that was made by others, and not
by himself, he was not responsible." [_Neal's N. E._, I. 190.]

Not being inclined to comply with the request of the court, that he
would, "out of a regard to the public peace, leave the Colony, of his
own accord," he was sentenced "to be disfranchised, to be banished
the jurisdiction, and to be taken into custody immediately, unless he
should give security to depart before the end of March." Appeal not
being admitted, and declining to give bail, he was taken into custody,
but released the next day, on "declaring himself willing to submit to a
simple banishment." [_Neal's N. E._, I. 191.]

Mr. Wheelwright, having purchased lands of the Indians at Squamscot
Falls, with a number of his adherents began a plantation in 1638,
which, according to agreement made with Mason's agent, they called
Exeter. "Having obtained a dismission from the church in Boston, _they
formed themselves_ into a church; and judging themselves without the
jurisdiction of Massachusetts, they combined into a separate body
politic," &c. [_Belknap_, I. 37.] This combination continued three
years. The names of those dismissed from Boston were John Wheelwright,
Richard Merrys, Richard Bulgar, Philemon Purmont, Isaac Gosse,
Christopher Marshall, George Baytes, Thomas Wardell, William Wardell.
[_Dr. Belknap from Boston Chh. Records._] "When Exeter came under the
jurisdiction of Massachusetts, Mr. Wheelwright, being still under
sentence of banishment, with those of his church who were resolved
to adhere to him, removed into the Province of Maine, and settled at
Wells. He was soon after restored, upon a slight acknowledgment, to
the freedom of the Colony; and in 1647 accepted an invitation from the
church in Hampton, and settled as colleague with Mr. Dalton." "After
his dismission from Hampton church he went to England, where he was in
favor with Cromwell, with whom he had in early life been associated
at the University of Cambridge in England. After Charles II. came
to the throne, Mr. Wheelwright returned to New England, and took up
his residence at Salisbury, where he died, November 15, 1679, aged,
probably, about 85 years." [_Dow's Hist. Address at Hampton._]

Neal, although his sympathies were with the opponents of Wheelwright,
mentions him as being "afterwards an useful minister in the town of
Hampton." Dr. Cotton Mather, while he justifies the proceedings of
the court against Mr. Wheelwright, accounts him "a man that had the
root of the matter in him." Having quoted at large Mr. Wheelwright's
address to the government, Dr. Mather says, "Upon this most ingenious
acknowledgement, he was restored unto his former liberty, and
interest among the people of God; and lived almost 40 years after,
a valued servant of the church, in his generation." Referring to
some publications of the day, in which Mr. Wheelwright was charged
with being heretical, Dr. Mather said, "_this good man_ published a
vindication of himself, against the wrongs that had been done unto
him." In this vindication were quoted the words of Mr. Cotton--"I
do conceive and profess, that our brother Wheelwright's doctrine
is according to God, in the points controverted." Mr. Wheelwright
also produced "a declaration from the whole general court of the
Colony, signed by the secretary," in which "they now signify, that
Mr. Wheelwright hath, for these many years, approved himself a sound
orthodox, and profitable minister of the gospel, among the churches of
Christ." [_Magnalia_, II. 443.]

Dr. Mather's own opinion of Mr. Wheelwright was expressed in a letter
to G. Vaughan, Esq., in 1708. "Mr. Wheelwright was always a gentleman
of the most unspotted morals imaginable; a man of a most unblemished
reputation." "His worst enemies never looked on him as chargeable with
the least ill practices." [_Belknap's Biog._, III. 338.]

The sermon of Mr. Wheelwright which gave offence in 1636, is still
preserved in manuscript. The Hon. Jeremiah Smith, late of Exeter, N.
H., who had read it, and who was fully competent to judge of its legal
bearings, said that he found in it no ground for a charge of sedition.
The charge was "wholly groundless, there was not the least color for
it." [_Judge Smith's MS._]

Mr. Wheelwright was settled over the first church in Salisbury, Ms.,
Dec. 9, 1662. [_Rev. J. B. Felt._] In 1671, at the ordination of Rev.
Joshua Moody, at Portsmouth, Mr. Wheelwright gave the Right Hand
of Fellowship. One of Mr. Wheelwright's descendants, of the ninth
generation, Rev. Rufus Wheelwright Clark, is now pastor of that church
in Portsmouth. Mr. Wheelwright's last will "names his son Samuel,
son-in-law Edward Rishworth, his grandchildren Edward Lyde, Mary White,
Mary Maverick, and William, Thomas, and Jacob Bradbury." [_Farmer's
Geneal. Reg._] Thomas Wheelwright of Wells, was also a son of Rev.
John Wheelwright. For an interesting account, containing other facts
respecting Mr. Wheelwright, see "Collectanea" by Hon. J. Kelly, in
Exeter News Letter, May 24, 1842.

Two of the descendants of the Rev. Mr. Wheelwright, of the seventh
generation, are now living in Newburyport. Abraham Wheelwright, Esq.,
and Ebenezer Wheelwright, Esq., both merchants. The first is the oldest
man in the place who is still able to walk abroad, having attained to
the age of 90 years. He was a soldier in the Revolutionary war, and
was distinguished for patriotism and bravery. He was in the field with
Washington in most of his actions, and was several times taken prisoner
by the British, but always effected his escape.

"The first church formed in Exeter became extinct a few years after
its formation." [_Dow's Hist. Address; Farmer & Moore._] "An attempt
was made by the remaining inhabitants of Exeter to form themselves
into a church, and settle Mr. Batchelder, who had been minister at
Hampton." This the general court prohibited, on account of their
divisions; and directed them to "defer gathering a church, or any other
such proceeding, till they, or the court of Ipswich, upon further
satisfaction of their reconciliation and fitness, should give allowance
therefor." [_Belknap's Biog._, I. 58.]

The _Rev. Samuel Dudley_ was the _second minister_ in Exeter. It does
not appear that there was any formal church organization there, during
his ministry. In some circumstances, a minister labored with a people
several years, before a church was formally organized. Rev. Joshua
Moody was ten or twelve years in the ministry at Portsmouth, before a
church was gathered in that place.

Mr. Dudley was son of Gov. Thomas Dudley, who came to New England in
1630, and of whom Farmer speaks, as "a man of approved wisdom and
godliness." Gov. Dudley was, however, among the most zealous of those
who effected the banishment of Wheelwright. Cotton Mather says, "His
orthodox piety had no little influence unto the deliverance of the
country, from the contagion of the famalistical errors, which had like
to have overturned all." [_Mag._, I. 122.]

A short passage from Farmer should be introduced here, not merely as
relating to the persecution, which led to the settlement of Exeter,
by Wheelwright, but as it gives a just representation of the Puritan
character in those times. "Through the whole of his life, Governor
Dudley opposed and denounced what he deemed to be heresy with an honest
zeal, which, in these days of universal toleration, is sometimes
referred to, as a blot upon his fame. But the candid and judicious, who
are acquainted with the history of the Puritans, and the circumstances
under which 'they came into a corner of the new world, and with an
immense toil and charge made a wilderness habitable, on purpose there
to be undisturbed in the exercise of their worship,' will never be
found censuring and railing at their errors. They will rather wonder
at the wisdom of the views, the disinterested nobleness of principle,
and self-sacrificing heroism, displayed by these wonderful men, to whom
the world is indebted for the most perfect institutions of civil and
religious freedom known among men." [_Am. Quar. Reg._ Vol. XV. 301.]

Mr. Dudley of Exeter is noted in Fitch's MS. as "a person of good
capacity and learning." [_Belknap_, I. 53.] He was born in England
in 1606. In New England, he resided in Cambridge, in Boston, and in
Salisbury. He was Representative of Salisbury in 1644. His ministry
in Exeter he commenced in 1650, and died there in 1683, aged 77.
In 1656 the inhabitants of Portsmouth voted "to give an invitation
to Mr. Samuel Dudley, son of Thomas Dudley, the Deputy Governor of
Massachusetts, to be their minister, and to give him a salary of eighty
pounds a year." He accepted the proposition, and agreed to visit them
the next spring; but it does not appear that he ever came. [_Adams's
Annals of Portsmouth._] Mr. Dudley's first wife was Mary, daughter of
Governor Winthrop. She died at Salisbury, April 12, 1643. He had a
second and a third wife. Besides his descendants of the name of Dudley,
there are numerous families in New Hampshire, and elsewhere, who trace
their descent from Mr. Dudley of Exeter. Among his descendants were the
wife of Gen. Henry Dearborn; the wife of Rev. John Moody; the wife of
John Burgin; the wife of Gov. James Sullivan; the grandmother of Tobias
Lear, Washington's secretary; and also the mother of Gov. Langdon.
For a long list of descendants of Rev. Samuel Dudley, see Exeter News
Letter, Aug. 31, 1846.

The _Rev. John Clark_ was the _third_ minister in Exeter.

A church, which continues under the style of the First Church in
Exeter, was _organized_ in September, 1698. In the Hampton Church
Records is the following entry: "1698. Sept. 11, Dismissed, in order
to their being incorporated into a church state, in Exeter, Mr. Moses
Leavitt, Mr. Henry Wadley, Jno. Scribner, Mrs. Elisabeth Clark, Mrs.
Elisabeth Gilman, wife of Cap. Gilman, Mrs. Tipping, Mrs. Deborah
Coffin, Goodwife Bean, Mrs. Mary Gilman, Mrs. Elisabeth Wadley, Mrs.
Sarah Dudley, Sarah Sewal, Deborah Sinclar. And Mr. Wear and Cap. Dow
were chosen, messengers of the church, to assist in the ordination of
Mr. Jno. Clark, at Exeter." The persons who have been mentioned, as
having been formerly admitted to the church in Hampton, (most or all of
whom lived in Exeter,) constituted nearly half the number, who entered
into a church state at Exeter.

The most ancient volume extant of the records of the present "First
Church of Christ in Exeter" commences thus, "The order of proceeding in
_gathering_ a particular Church in Exeter."

"After conferring together, and being mutually satisfied in each other,
we drew up a confession of faith, and the terms of the covenant, which
we all signed, the sabbath before ordination. And having sent for the
Rev. Mr. J. Hale, (who preached the ordination sermon,) Mr. Woodbridge,
Mr. Pike, Mr. Rolfe, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Toppan, who accordingly came;
and on the twenty-first of September, 1698, Mr. Hale, Woodbridge, Pike,
and Cotton, laid on hands, Mr. Pike praying before the imposition
of hands; Mr. Woodbridge gave the charge; Mr. Cotton gave the right
hand of fellowship; and we were, by the elders, and messengers, of
the several churches, _owned as a Church of Christ_, and John Clark
declared to be a minister of Christ Jesus." No doubt Mr. John Hale, of
Beverly, was the preacher. He had recently married the widowed mother
of Mr. Clark. The other ministers mentioned were undoubtedly Rev.
Messrs. Benjamin Woodbridge, minister first at Bristol, R. I., who
preached at Kittery in 1688, and, as early as 1699, in Medford; John
Pike of Dover; Benjamin Rolfe of Haverhill, Ms., who was killed by the
Indians; John Cotton of Hampton; and Christopher Toppan of Newbury. The
father of Rev. John Clark of Exeter was Nathaniel Clark, a merchant
of Newbury, and one of the early settlers of that town, who married,
Nov. 25, 1663, Elisabeth Somerby, daughter of Henry Somerby, one of the
grantees of Newbury. Nathaniel Clark was in the expedition to Canada in
1690, and died there, Aug. 25, aged 46, having been wounded on board
the ship "Six Friends." His widow, Elisabeth Clark, married Rev. John
Hale of Beverly, Aug. 8, 1698. Mr. Hale was chaplain in the expedition
in which Nathaniel Clark was mortally wounded. A particular account of
Mr. Hale does not belong to this article. Of his views and influence in
the affairs of the "Salem Witchcraft" see Amer. Quar. Reg. Vol. X. pp.
247, 248. In that account there is, however, doubtless a mistake as to
the original name of the widow of Nathaniel Clark. See also Magnalia,
II. 408, and Coffin's Newbury, p. 298. Rev. Mr. Clark of Exeter was
born at Newbury, June 24, 1670, gr. H. C. 1690, and ordained at Exeter,
Sept. 21, 1698; "married Elisabeth Woodbridge, a daughter of the Rev.
Benjamin Woodbridge, already mentioned, and granddaughter of Rev. John
Woodbridge, first minister of Andover, and also of Rev. John Ward,
first minister of Haverhill, June 19, 1694,--Rev. John Clark died July
25, 1705," aged 35. His children were Benjamin, Nathaniel, Deborah, and
Ward, who was the first minister of Kingston. The mother of Elisabeth
Woodbridge was Mary, daughter of John Ward.

The Woodbridge family has furnished a number of ministers distinguished
for talents, learning, piety, and an excellent spirit. Were the notices
of them collected, which are scattered in various publications, they
would form an interesting memoir.

_Rev. John Odlin_, the fourth minister of Exeter, and the second
minister of the present First Church, was son of Elisha, and grandson
of John Odlin, one of the first settlers of Boston. Rev. John Odlin
was born in Boston, Nov. 18, 1681, gr. H. C. 1702, ordained at Exeter,
Nov. 11, 1706. He married, Oct. 21, 1709, Mrs. Elisabeth Woodbridge
Clark, widow of his predecessor. Mr. Odlin was one of the proprietors
of Gilmanton. His son, Capt. John Odlin, was one of the settlers of
that town. Another of his sons, Dudley, was a physician. Elisha gr. H.
C. 1731, and settled in the ministry in Amesbury; Woodbridge was his
father's colleague and successor in Exeter. Mrs. Odlin, wife of Rev.
John Odlin, d. Dec. 6, 1729. His second marriage was Oct. 22, 1730,
with Elisabeth Briscoe, widow of Robert Briscoe, and formerly wife of
Lieut. James Dudley, and daughter of Samuel Leavitt. Mr. Odlin d. Nov.
20, 1754, aged about 73, nearly eleven years after his son became his
colleague. [_Farmer's Reg._; _Lancaster's Gilmanton_; _Exeter Church
Cov._] In 1743, May 18, the church "voted to concur with the vote of
the town in choosing Mr. Woodbridge Odlin to settle as a colleague
with his hon'd father the Rev. John Odlin." During the same month
"there were a number of the church separated from their communion."
The circumstances will be noticed in the account of the formation of
another church.

_Rev. Woodbridge Odlin_ was ordained colleague pastor Sept. 28, 1743.
The exercises were, Prayer by Rev. Wm. Allen of Greenland; Sermon
by Rev. Mr. Odlin from Col. i: 28; Charge by Rev. Caleb Cushing of
Salisbury; Right Hand by Rev. Mr. Rust of Stratham; and Prayer by Rev.
Joseph Adams of Newington. Rev. W. Odlin was born at Exeter, April 28,
1718; gr. H. C. 1738, m. Oct. 23, 1755, Mrs. Abigail Strong, widow
of Rev. Job Strong of Portsmouth, and daughter of Col. Peter Gilman.
Mr. W. Odlin d. March 10, 1776, aged 57. His children were Dudley,
Woodbridge, Peter, Elisabeth, Abigail, who was the first wife of Hon.
Nathaniel Gilman of Exeter, John, Mary Ann, who was wife of Thomas
Stickney of Concord, and Charlotte, wife of Jeremiah Stickney of Dover.
[_Lancaster's Gilmanton_; _Exeter Church Records_.] Rev. W. Odlin,
during his ministry of more than thirty-two years, baptized 1,276, and
admitted 36 persons to the church. [_Chh. Records._] The "Half-way
covenant," as it was often called, was then in use, and this accounts
for the great disproportion between the admissions to full communion
and the baptisms. "It provided that all persons of sober life and
correct sentiments without being examined as to a change of heart
might profess religion or become members of the church and have their
children baptized though they did not come to the Lord's table." [_Dr.
Hawes' Lectures_, p. 149.]

_Rev. Isaac Mansfield_ succeeded Rev. W. Odlin, and was ord. Oct. 9,
1776. The exercises were Prayer by the Rev. Mr. Tucker of Newbury;
Sermon by Rev. Mr. Thayer of Hampton, from Ezek. xxxiii: 7-9; Charge
by Rev. Mr. Fogg of Kensington; Right Hand by Rev. Mr. Webster of
Salisbury, 2nd chh.; Prayer by Rev. Edmund Noyes of Salisbury, 1st
chh. There were also invited on the ordaining council the churches in
Brentwood, Dover, Epping, Greenland, 1st in Cambridge, 2nd in Scituate,
and 2nd in Amesbury. Mr. Mansfield was born at Marblehead, Ms., in
1750, gr. H. C. 1767, also M. A. at D. C., 1770; married Mary, daughter
of Nathaniel Clap of Scituate, Ms. Mr. Mansfield, "according to his
agreement with the parish," was dismissed Aug. 22, 1787, by a council
of three churches, of which Messrs. Fogg, Langdon, then of Hampton
Falls, and Macclintock were pastors. The result is in the church
records. It does not state the circumstances which produced "such a
crisis as to render a separation eligible on both parts;" but the
council say, "We feel ourselves constrained by duty and love to testify
the sense we have of the valuable ministerial gifts and qualifications
with which God hath furnished Mr. Mansfield, and which have been well
approved not only among his own people, but by the churches in this
vicinity." During Mr. Mansfield's ministry of nearly eleven years, 245
were baptized, and 12 admitted to the church. Mr. Mansfield removed to
Marblehead. He became a magistrate, and was afterwards known as Isaac
Mansfield, Esq. His sons, Theodore and Isaac, were born in Exeter. Mrs.
Mansfield died in Marblehead, Feb. 11, 1806, aged 59. He d. in Boston,
Sept., 1826, aged 76. His father was also Isaac Mansfield, Esq., of
Marblehead: "a gentleman of handsome literary acquirements, and spent
his days in piety and usefulness." He died April 12, 1792, aged 72.
He is supposed to be the same who graduated at H. C., 1742. [_Alden's
Col._]

_Rev. William Frederick Rowland_ was born in Plainfield, Ct., in
1761, gr. D. C. 1784, also M. A. at Yale, 1787. He was ordained
in Exeter, June 2, 1790. The churches invited were Hampton Falls,
North Hampton, Hampton, 2nd Salisbury, 1st Newbury, 1st Newburyport,
Greenland, Stratham, 2nd Exeter, Brattle Street, Boston, Charlestown,
2nd Portland. The exercises were, Prayer by Dr. Macclintock; Sermon
by Dr. Thacher of Boston; Ordaining Prayer by Dr. Langdon; Charge by
Dr. Webster; Right Hand by Dr. Macclintock; Prayer by Dr. Morse. Mr.
Rowland m. Sally, daughter of Col. Eliphalet Ladd of Portsmouth. She
died Oct. 12, 1798, at the early age of 24. Extracts from the sermon
of Dr. Buckminster of Portsmouth at her funeral, may be found in
Alden's Collection, Vol. II., p. 66. Mr. Rowland's 2nd marriage was
with Ann, daughter of Col. Eliphalet Giddings of Exeter. She died June
13, 1811, aged 31. Her infant was buried with her. After a ministry of
thirty-eight years, Mr. Rowland asked and received a dismission. It
took place Dec. 5, 1828. The ministers of the council, whose result is
in the church records, were Rev. Messrs. Hurd of Exeter, Sanford of
Newmarket, Spofford of Brentwood, and Cummings of Stratham. Mr. Rowland
deceased June 10, 1843, aged 82, leaving four children, Sarah Ann, Mary
Elisabeth, William Frederick, and Theresa Orne. Mary Elisabeth died in
1845. The sermon at the funeral of Mr. Rowland was preached by the Rev.
Mr. Hurd. Mr. Rowland's father was Rev. David S. Rowland, gr. Yale,
1743; settled first at Plainfield, Ct., and afterwards at Windsor, Ct.;
where his son, Henry A. Rowland, was ordained his successor, in 1790.
During Mr. Rowland's ministry at Exeter, there were 128 admissions
to the church, and 295 baptisms. He possessed good talents, was very
respectable as a preacher, and gifted in prayer.

_Rev. John Smith_ was born in Wethersfield, Ct.; gr. Y. C., 1821;
ordained at Trenton, N. J., March 7, 1826; dismissed Aug., 1828.
Inst. in Exeter, March 12, 1829. Exercises on the occasion: Prayer by
Rev. Abraham Burnham of Pembroke, N. H.; Sermon by Rev. N. Bouton of
Concord; Prayer, Rev. Mr. Miltimore of Newbury; Charge, Rev. Dr. Dana,
Newburyport; Right Hand, Rev. Mr. Hurd of Exeter; Address, Rev. Mr.
Withington of Newbury; Prayer by Rev. Mr. Winslow, then of Dover, now
of Boston. Mr. Smith's "relation to the people of his charge in Exeter,
continued nearly nine years with mutual harmony and affection and
with much advantage to the cause of religion." [_Result of Council._]
At his own request, he was dismissed Feb. 14, 1838, and accepted
an appointment from the Amer. Tract Society, to superintend their
operations in New Jersey, and in Southern New York and vicinity. He
was afterwards installed in Wilton, Ct. During Mr. Smith's ministry in
Exeter, the number of admissions to the church was 170, and the number
of baptisms 139. The number of church members reported to the General
Association in 1836, was 226. Of the children of the Rev. John and Mrs.
Esther Smith, there were baptized at Exeter, James Dickinson, Jan. 7,
1830; Esther Mary, June 9, 1833; a second Esther Mary, Oct. 5, 1835;
and Walter Mitchell, June 4, 1837.

_Rev. William Williams_ was born in Wethersfield, Ct., Oct. 2, 1797,
grad. Y. C., 1816; studied theology at Andov. Sem., and with Pres.
Timothy Dwight. Settled in Salem over the Branch, since the Howard St.
Church, July 5, 1821; dismissed Feb. 17, 1832; settled over the Crombie
St. Church, which had separated from the Howard St. Nov. 22, 1832.
[_Amer. Quar. Reg._, Vol. VII., p. 260.] He was installed at Exeter,
May 31, 1838. Exercises on the occasion: Prayer by Rev. S. T. Abbott of
Seabrook; Sermon by Rev. Milton P. Bramin of Danvers; Prayer by Rev. S.
W. Clark of Greenland; Charge by Rev. J. French of North Hampton; Right
Hand, Rev. J. Hurd of Exeter; Address by Rev. Edwin Holt of Portsmouth;
Prayer by Rev. Mr. Gunnison of Brentwood. Mr. Williams resigned his
ministry, Oct. 1, 1842, on account of the state of his health, taken
in connection with existing difficulties. Mr. Williams returned to
Salem, Ms., where he engaged in the study, and has been since in the
practice of medicine. The number of members of Mr. Williams's church,
as reported in 1841, was 217.

_Rev. Joy Hamlet Fairchild_ was born in Guilford. Ct., April 24,
1789, and was the youngest of sixteen children. His father was Lewis
Fairchild. His mother before marriage was Mehetabel Waterhouse of
Saybrook, Ct. Rev. Mr. Fairchild grad. Y. C. 1813, studied theology
with Dr. Ely of Monson, Ms., and settled in the ministry in East
Hartford, Ct., June, 1816; in South Boston, Phillips Church, Nov.,

the occasion were: Reading of the Scriptures, Rev. S. W. Clark of
Greenland; Prayer, Rev. R. W. Clark, Portsmouth; Sermon, Rev. N. Adams,
Boston; Prayer, Rev. J. French; Charge, Rev. Dr. Codman; Right Hand,
Rev. Mr. Hurd; Address, Rev. H. Winslow of Boston; Prayer, Rev. E.
D. Eldredge of Hampton. Mr. Fairchild resigned his office June 18,
1844. His reasons are thus assigned in his letter to the church. "I am
accused of a crime which I never committed, but which it is not in my
power to disprove. I do not wish to preach the gospel any longer than I
can be useful. And as my usefulness must now be ended, I hereby resign
my office as Pastor of this church." His pastoral relation was formally
dissolved by a Council, called at his own request, July 30, 1844. The
doings of the ecclesiastical and civil tribunals in his case are in the
hands of the public. After removing from Exeter he was installed over
the Payson Church, South Boston, Nov. 19. 1845.

Mr. Fairchild m. 1st, Cynthia Waterhouse of Saybrook, Ct., Oct., 1814.

MEMOIR OF ENOCH PARSONS, ESQ., OF HARTFORD, CT.


The name of PARSONS is found among the earliest emigrants to New
England, and it designated a family of high respectability in the
parent country. As early as 1481, John Parsons was Mayor of Hereford in
the county of Herefordshire, and Sir Thomas Parsons of Great Milton,
from one branch of the family, received the honor of knighthood from
Charles I., about the year 1634, and his descendants are still found
at Great Milton and in the city of London. The Coat of Arms granted to
Sir Thomas is thus described: "He beareth gules, two chevrons ermine,
between three eagles displayed, or;" Crest: "an eagle's leg erased at
the thigh, or, standing on a leopard's head, gules."

These armorial bearings are retained in the Parsons Family in the
United States, and by the descendants of Sir Thomas in London, among
whom were Sir John and Sir Humphrey Parsons, the former Lord Mayor of
London in 1704, and the latter in 1731 and 1740; also by the branch of
the family that settled in Barbadoes, of which Rev. John Parsons, M.
A., of Beybrook House in the county of Gloucester, Vicar of Marden,
county of Wilts, is a descendant, being the son of Daniel Parsons, M.
D., of Barbadoes.

ENOCH PARSONS, ESQ., of Hartford, Ct., the particular subject of this
memoir, was born at Lyme, Ct., Nov. 5, 1769. He was the third son of
Samuel Holden Parsons, an Aid to General Washington, a Major-General in
the Revolutionary army, and subsequently, Chief-Justice of the North
Western Territory. Mr. Parsons was also grandson of the Rev. Jonathan
Parsons, a distinguished clergyman first of Lyme, Ct., and secondly of
Newburyport, Ms. His mother, who was a daughter of Richard Mather of
Lyme, was lineally descended from the Rev. Richard Mather, the first
clergyman of Dorchester, Ms., ancestor of the Rev. Messrs. Increase and
Cotton Mather of Boston. His grandmother was sister to the Hon. Matthew
Griswold of Lyme, formerly Governor of the State, and was lineally
descended from Henry Wolcott, 1st, of Windsor, the progenitor of all
who bear that name in Connecticut.[T]

Mr. Parsons was distinguished in youth for mental vigor and accurate
discrimination, and for his devotedness to the more abstruse and severe
sciences, particularly the mathematics. This laid the foundation of
his future eminence as a financier. He did not receive a collegiate
education, but his academical course pursued at the Institutions at
Pomfret and Plainfield, was extensive and thorough. His favorite
studies naturally inclined him to commercial pursuits; and to qualify
himself for these, he engaged in the year 1785 and 1786, in the
service of Messrs. Broome and Platt, who, at that time, owned a great
commercial house in New Haven, where he acquired a complete mercantile
education. His proficiency and accuracy as an accountant soon brought
him into notice, and in the year 1787 he was employed by the late Gov.
Oliver Wolcott, Jun., who was at that time State Auditor of accounts,
to arrange and prepare for adjustment the Revolutionary claims of
Connecticut upon the United States. This was an arduous task for a
young man, requiring great methodical accuracy and precision, and it
was performed with ability and acceptance.

But Mr. Parsons was not confined to his favorite pursuits; he had a
thirst for knowledge generally, and improved every opportunity for
research in the various departments of science and the arts with a
proportionate zeal and accuracy. Evidences of this are furnished in a
Journal[U] which he, at the age of only nineteen, kept while on a tour
to the North Western Territory during the spring and summer of 1788, in
company with his father, who was about that time appointed by President
Washington Chief-Judge in and over the Territory, which included the
States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan. The geology of the
country, the customs, manners, and language of the native sons of the
forest, are described and commented upon with a minuteness and vivacity
interesting alike to the geologist, the antiquary, and the philosopher.

He was, we believe, one of the original investigators of the tumuli
at Marietta, the first and at that time the only settlement of
importance in that region of country. A description of one of these
remarkable mounds, excavated and explored by him, he communicated in
1789 to President Stiles of Yale College, and is preserved among his
manuscripts in the College Library.

May 14, 1789, Mr. Parsons was appointed by Gov. Arthur St. Clair,
Register and Clerk of the first Probate Record Office, established in
the county of Washington, which was the first county erected north-west
of the river Ohio. He there remained, faithfully discharging the
duties of this appointment, until April, 1790, when he resigned and
returned to Middletown, Ct., his family residence, and was appointed
by the General Assembly of the State at their ensuing session, in May,
High Sheriff of Middlesex County. This office he accepted, being then
only twenty-one years of age; and he continued to perform its duties
with fidelity and public acceptance, till he attained the age of 49,
a period of _twenty-eight_ years; when he was compelled by ill health
and various imperative avocations, to relinquish its fatigues and
solicitude.

During the period of his official duties as Sheriff, Mr. Parsons was
also actively engaged in various other public avocations, and in
mercantile business. He was called to preside over different local
institutions and organizations in the place where he resided; acted
a while as Secretary to an Insurance Company, and was repeatedly
elected an Alderman of the city of Middletown, and Representative
in the General Assembly of the State. He was also presented by his
Congressional friends as a rival candidate of the late President
Harrison in the year 1791 for the office of Secretary and ex-officio
Lieut. Governor of the N. W. Territory, but he declined the nomination.
He likewise declined the honor, though repeatedly solicited, to
represent his fellow-citizens in the councils of the nation. His own
private affairs too much required his attention to permit him to engage
in this high trust.

In the year 1816, when the late Bank of the United States was
incorporated, Mr. Parsons, believing that the establishment of
a Branch in Connecticut, (by many deemed impracticable,) would
materially promote the commercial interests of its citizens, visited
Philadelphia in company with other gentlemen, with a view to this
object. By the most persevering efforts, and through his active and
efficient influence and exertion, a Branch was located in Connecticut
at Middletown. He was chosen a Director of the institution immediately
upon its organization, and continued in the direction during the
existence of the Charter.

In 1818 he was elected President of the Connecticut Branch, on the
resignation of the Hon. Samuel W. Dana, then a Senator in Congress;
and was annually elected, until it was transferred from Middletown to
Hartford, in the spring of 1824. Having removed thither himself about
the same time, he was re-elected, and continued to preside over the
institution with acknowledged impartiality, ability, and firmness, and
the most unflinching integrity, during the operations of the Branch in
Connecticut, and until the expiration of the Charter.

Though educated a merchant and eminent as a financier, Mr. Parsons
was also a sound _lawyer_; not by profession or practice, but by the
acquisition of the requisite legal knowledge. The office of Sheriff,
when he was called to fill it, was one of honor as well as profit.
Its incumbent was the companion of the Judges. He attended at their
"chambers" as well as in the "court-room." He listened to, and
participated in, their deliberations and discussions. Thus Mr. Parsons
breathed a legal atmosphere. Being by his official duties, through
a period of _twenty-eight_ years, in familiar intercourse with the
_Bench_ and the _Bar_, and having read the best elementary writers,
endowed, as he was, with a remarkably retentive memory and a logical
and inquisitive mind, it is not surprising that he retained to the
close of life the principles and maxims of jurisprudence thus deeply
implanted. Though not a member of the Bar, his opinions on elementary
points were seldom questioned.

Mr. Parsons wrote some, but reflected more. His published writings are
few and chiefly _political_. His unpublished manuscripts are numerous
and mostly in an _epistolary_ form, relating principally to the subject
of _finance_.

In all the relations of domestic and social life, Mr. Parsons was
beloved and respected. He was twice married, and left three children
by the first marriage, and one by the second; two only of whom survive
him; namely, one residing in Hartford, Ct., Samuel H. Parsons, Esq.,
and one in the State of Ohio. In these relations, he was ever the
generous and affectionate husband, and the kind and faithful parent.
His habits and feelings were social and communicative; and in his
intercourse with his fellow-men, dignity was seen blended with the
utmost courtesy and kindness. He was a true gentleman of the olden
school, and every son of New England will understand what this means.

His personal appearance was dignified and commanding. His stature large
and well-proportioned; high forehead and bald, with dark blue eye, and
a countenance indicative of his mental characteristics of thought,
deliberation and energy, blended with mildness.

Mr. Parsons was a firm believer in the Christian religion. He adopted
the principles of the gospel as the standard of human action; and
frequently remarked, that through life he had made it an invariable
rule never to close his eyes in sleep without first communing with his
God.

About a year previous to the close of his interesting life, his system
became generally debilitated, and during the last three or four months
he was unable to leave the house. He expressed himself perfectly
resigned to the will of Heaven, and gradually sunk into a lethargy,
which continued until the morning of July 9, 1846, when he slept in
death, in the 77th year of his age.

FOOTNOTES:

[T] A more extended genealogical account of the Parsons Family may be
expected in some future No. of the Register.

[U] In his Journal, Mr. Parsons gives the following statistics of the
Aborigines, at that time inhabiting the Territory, which may not be
uninteresting to compare with their present condition. We present the
extract entire:

    "The _Delawares_ live at Sandusky, in a N. W. course and about 180
    miles from this place, (Marietta.) Their number is 400.

    "The _Wyandots_, living partly in the same region and partly at
    Detroit, 300 miles from Marietta, are about 260 in number.

    "The _Munsees_ live on the Alleghany river, about 310 miles N. E.
    from M. and number 100.

    "The _Miami_ tribe live at Miami town, W. S. W. 250 miles, and are
    about 100 in number.

    "The _Shawanoes_ live on the Miami river, S. W. 250 miles, and
    number 150.

    "The _Kickapoes_ live also upon the Wabash, S. S. W. 500 miles, and
    number 1100.

    "The _Piankishaws_ live upon the same river, S. and S. W. 600
    miles--number 400.

    "The _Kaskaskias_ live on the Mississippi, S. S. W. 800 miles.
    Their number is 150.

    "The _Peorees_ live upon the Illinois river, W. S. W. 900 miles.
    Number 150.

    "The _Meadow Indians_ live also upon the Illinois, about 900 miles
    W. by S. Number 500.

    "The _Iowas_ live upon the Illinois, S. W. 900 miles, numbering 300.

    1000.

    "The _Sieux_ live N. W. of Lake Superior. N. W. from Marietta 950
    miles. Number 6000."

In his Journal we have also a specimen of the fertility of the soil,
and the rapidity of the vegetation of the Territory, in the following
extracts:

    "June 7. Rode out with my father to his three-acre lot, which was
    sowed with rye in December last. About twenty days ago, it was four
    inches high. Ten days since, when we visited it, it was three and
    a half feet high; and to-day we found it seven and a half feet in
    height.

    "June 13. Measured a spear of flax growing on my city lot, and find
    that in six days it has grown seven inches. Mr. Converse informs
    me that about three weeks ago, he planted corn, which is at the
    present time four feet high."

On subsequent pages of the Journal, Mr. P. has extended remarks on the
philosophy of vegetation.

We have further space only for the following curious extract:

    "June 15. Last night the dogs made a most hideous clamor, and
    seemed to be exceedingly excited. Mr.----, who lives about forty
    rods N. of the Stockade, was about getting up to see what disturbed
    them, but did not; and in the morning, on opening the outer door to
    let in his dog, he found in his mouth a _purse filled with Brooches
    and Rings_."






THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE.


    My Muse has oft slumbered in life's busy day,
      And seldom I've sought her, as having no leisure;
    At the moment, however, while time glides away
      In the quiet of age, let me yield to the pleasure.

    And oh! in the scenes on my fancy that burst,
      And on which with delight or with sadness I linger,
    Say, what shall arrest my attention the first?
      Where, where shall I place me--where point the fixed finger?

    Shall I dwell upon childhood, or press on to youth,
      Or look only on manhood, or Death's lessons ponder?
    Shall I mourn, or rejoice, or administer truth,
      Or most at man's folly or GOD'S mercy wonder?

    I gaze on the palace, contemplate the cot,
      Mark the tower, see the ocean, view landscapes wide-spreading;
    And I feel, while I think on man's changeable lot,
      Compassion its influence o'er my heart shedding:

    And I cry, 'O ye triflers, ye murmurers, say,
      'Could your wishes be realized, what were the blessing
    'Most anxiously sought, to make happy your day
      'Of existence, and crown you with bliss worth possessing?'

    'I'd have power,' says the statesman; 'broad empire,' the king;
      'More lands,' shouts the rich; and 'no labor,' the peasant;
    And so through the catalogue! Hope seeks to bring
      Enjoyment from change, and depreciates the present:

    While yet, would we weigh our condition with care,
      And be just to that Wisdom our follies which chastens,
    We should see many blessings that fall to our share,
      Though the crown of our wishes its advent ne'er hastens.

    GOD denies in His love, and withholds what we seek,
      In tender compassion, well knowing our blindness.
    Let us yield, be submissive, and patient, and meek,
      Adoring His mercy, and trusting His kindness.

    This, this is our wisdom. Alone it deserves
      The name of philosophy; nor can the science
    Man proudly may boast, while as yet he but serves
      His passions, afford for his woes an appliance.

    This life is a trial. Our world cannot fill
      The void of the heart, which too surely is boundless.
    GOD will discipline, rectify, govern man's will,
      And eternity show our complaining is groundless:

    There, we may, when we _know_ what we see here in part,
      Life's philosophy prize, as we find it resulting
    In bliss springing forth from a purified heart,
      Without ceasing, in love, joy, and wonder exulting.

    Why should we not, then, as life hurries away,
      Submit us to GOD, and fall in with the measures
    His Wisdom employs, from His paths lest we stray,
      And fail to inherit His blood-purchased treasures?

REMARKS.

The following details are published not as being complete, but with
the hope that the publication of them may be as a magnet attracting
to itself, and thus supplying the wanting links which might otherwise
perish from the chain of a family history. Any information, however
slight, respecting any of the lines, whether direct or collateral,
hereby brought to light, will be welcomed by the author of this
article, or the editor of this journal.

We are still in the dark as to the family history of not a few among
the first fathers of New England. Much of this darkness might be
dispelled were all the written memorials still extant sought out,
compared, and committed to the keeping of the art preservative of all
arts. Winthrop in his Journal speaks of a letter from the Yarmouth
pilgrims to their brethren, with their names, as printed at London in
1630. The instructions to Endecott, the first Governor of Massachusetts
Bay, were "Keep a daily register in each family of what is done by all
and every person in the family."

In Young's Chronicles of Plymouth, (p. 36) and of Massachusetts Bay,
(p. 157), lists of names of emigrants are referred to, but the lists
themselves are not given.

Notwithstanding several good works upon the Huguenots have recently
appeared, much genealogical labor remains to be performed in tracing
the lineage of particular families to France, and investigating their
condition there before their emigration. I have often sought, though
without success, for the records of the Old French Church in Boston,
which stood on the site of the Universalist Church in School street.


NOTES.

1. Neither the family name of Stephen Butler's wife nor any other
particulars respecting him have been ascertained, except the record of
the births of his children, which is extracted from the city registers
of Boston, formerly kept in the Old State House. As he became a
father in Boston within little more than twenty years after its first
settlement, it may be presumed that he was an emigrant from Europe.

2. Benjamin Butler. The different dates in this and similar cases
denote the births of different children bearing the same name; the
former in all probability died before the birth of the latter.

3. James Butler probably died before 1692, if the Grace Butler, married
to Andrew Rankin, April 15th, of that year, by Simon Bradstreet, was
his widow.

4. Information as to the kindred of Abigail Eustice may doubtless be
found in the public records of Boston.

5. James Butler was a proprietor in a rope-walk at West Boston; was
married April 6, 1710, by Rev. E. Pemberton of the Old South. He was
probably admitted to the First Church Jan. 24, 1703-4. A folio Bible
with Clarke's annotations, now in my possession, as an heirloom from
my father and grandfather, bears the name of this James Butler, my
grandfather's grandfather, and the date 1713, doubtless written by his
own hand.

6. Grace Butler was married Dec. 26, 1706, to Thomas Jackson, by
Benjamin Wadsworth, minister of the first church. She had several
children, Grace, Thomas, and Elisabeth, and died March 15, 1759.

7. Eliza Butler was admitted to the first church Nov. 25, 1706, and was
married to Capt. Ephraim Savage, Jan. 8, 1712. Nothing further is known
of her.

8. James Butler was by trade a goldsmith. About 1750 he removed to
Halifax, Nova Scotia, but proving unfortunate in his enterprise, soon
returned to Boston. He afterwards lived awhile in Sutton, Ms., but died
in Boston, in 1776, aged 63.

9. Although I have abstained from full details of collateral lines, I
am constrained to give them respecting Elisabeth Davie, since her line
of ancestry is so long.

(a) The lineage of this nobleman, his heraldic emblazonings and the
like, may be found in Burke's Peerage of England; "vix ea nostra voco."

(b) Humphrey Davie was a captain in the London trade. Hence his
daughter had many fine dresses. One of these now belongs to her
granddaughter, Mrs. Sarah Kingsbury of Oxford, Ms.

It is of brocade, with many-colored figures embroidered upon a ground
of green. It has two skirts, each of seven breadths, a long bodice
to be worn with a satin stomacher, sleeves short at the elbows, with
flowing ruffles. A silver tabby christening, or to use a better
expression, _baptismal_, blanket, now in my possession, is said to
have been made of another of my great-grandmother's dresses. There is
a family tradition that these dresses were pawned by her husband after
her death, and redeemed by her son.

10. James Butler was brought up to the trade of a hatter; was married
May 10, 1763, by Rev. Andrew Eliot of New North Church; in Aug.,
1774, fled with his wife and six children under ten years of age, to
Georgetown, Me., a four days' voyage. He was driven to this flight by
the Boston port-bill, which brought all business to a stand. After
remaining four years in Maine, he returned to Boston, and soon removed
to Oxford, Ms.; where he resided till his death, Dec. 20, 1827, aged 88.

11. Mary Sigourney was great-granddaughter of a Sigourney, who, being
a Huguenot, fled from Rochelle in France, with his wife and four small
children, in 1685. This first emigrant was among the first settlers
in Oxford, Ms., and some of his children married there. Through fear
of Indians, he removed to Boston. I have made out an extensive table
of his posterity, but on account of its length, must refrain from
inserting it here, except so far as relates to my own family. Among
the descendants of this Huguenot exile, are the Brimmers, the Inches,
and the Dexters, of Boston; the Commander of the Schooner Asp, killed
by the British in the Potomac, in 1813; and the husband of our most
popular poetess.

       was early taught French by her grandmother,
       as the tongue of her ancestors;

THE MINOT FAMILY.

BY LEMUEL SHATTUCK, ESQ.


_Explanation of the Plan in preparing the Memoir_.

In the following Memoir the numbers inserted in the parentheses on the
left, are the numbers of the paragraphs, each, generally, containing
a notice of one entire family. The Roman numbers immediately after
indicate the generation of the family, including the first person
named. The descendants are doubly numbered--first in consecutive order,
and secondly by each family separately. The figures in brackets after
the name refer back to these numbers of the descendants, indicating the
family and connections to which the individual belongs. The numbers
inserted in the parentheses on the right, against the name of a child,
show the subsequent paragraph where a notice of the family of such
child may be found.

It is impossible to present a memoir of this kind, which shall be
entirely free from error, perfect and complete. In existing families,
births, marriages, and deaths, are constantly occurring, and in more
ancient ones new facts are often discovered. Such facts it is desirable
to have entered; and such a plan as would allow their insertion without
re-writing the memoir will be preferred. By leaving some space in the
original entries, the plan admits of correction, amplification, and
extension, without marring its simplicity and beauty.


MEMOIR.

(1) All by the name of Minot in America are supposed to have descended
from George Minot, whose posterity forms the subject of this Memoir.
There was a Thomas Minot, probably a brother, who was a proprietor of
Barbadoes in 1638, but I can neither trace his history, nor ascertain
that he left posterity. None of the name could be found in the New York
or Philadelphia Directories for 1846. The family are all descended from
Thomas Minot, Esq., Secretary to the Abbot of Walden, England, by whom
he was advanced to great possessions.


FIRST GENERATION.

(2) I. Elder George Minot was the son of Thomas Minot, Esq., of
Saffron-Walden, Essex, England, and was b. Aug. 4, 1594. He was among
the first Pilgrim emigrants to Massachusetts, and the first settlers
of Dorchester. His place of residence was near Neponset Bridge, and
he owned the land which has been known as "Squantum." He was made a
freeman in 1634, and represented the town in 1635 and 1636. He was
a ruling elder in the church thirty years, and d. Dec. 24, 1671, in
the 78th year of his age. He left a will, which is recorded in the
Suffolk Records, Vol. VII. p. 189. The inventory of his estate amounted
to £277. 7. 7. "His death," say the records, "was much lamented by
the town, whose weal he sought and liberties defended." He was a
cotemporary with Elder Humphrey; and it is said the following lines
were once to be found on a gravestone in the ancient burying-ground in
Dorchester:--

    Here lie the bodies of Unite Humphrey and Shining Minot,
    Such names as these, they never die not.

Mr. Minot's wife, Martha, d. in Dorchester, Dec. 23, 1657, a. 60. He
left the following children;

  31--1 Rebecca,        b. Feb.   9, 1685,  m. Joseph Barrett,

Barrett; two other sisters married brothers by the name of Adams; a
brother and a sister married a brother and sister by the name of Lane,
and two were born the same day and married the same day.

There are few parents who have so great reason to be "happy in a
virtuous posterity," as had these. One son was a minister, another
was a deacon, and eight of the grandchildren were deacons or married
to deacons; several were clergymen or married to clergymen. Very
many of the great-grandchildren sustained the same offices, or were
otherwise distinguished in military, civil, or religious life. A large
proportion of those who arrived at mature age professed religion; and
the succeeding and numerous families were among the most respected,
useful, and influential in the towns in which they lived. Very many
distinguished men descended from them; among whom were Rev. Stephen
and Hon. Timothy Farrar of New Ipswich, N. H., Roger Minot Sherman, of
Fairfield, Ct., and several eminent physicians by the name of Adams;
and Hon. Roger Sherman, and several other distinguished men of New
Haven married descendants.

          where he d. unmarried, May 12, 1783, a. 77.
  51--11 Peter, b. m. was drowned at Halifax with his wife.

right of their mother, Rebecca Bulkeley, deceased in Acton, allowed
to the heirs of her father John Jones, and to Dorothy Hunt, deceased,
the former wife of Samuel Hunt, one of the heirs of Rebecca Bulkeley."
Joseph Hubbard was the ancestor of most of the name in Concord.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES OF DECEASED PHYSICIANS IN MASSACHUSETTS.

BY EBENEZER ALDEN, M. D.

(Continued from page 64.)


IV.--DR. HENRY WELLS OF MONTAGUE.

Few physicians have enjoyed a more enviable reputation than the subject
of this Notice. He was the personal friend of Professor Nathan Smith of
Dartmouth College, who was accustomed to speak of him in terms of the
highest respect, and not unfrequently to allude, in his lectures, to
his medical opinions and modes of practice.

Although Dr. Wells was in the habit of keeping a record of his more
important cases, and of his views on medical subjects, he published but
little, and his papers having become by an unfortunate accident a prey
to the devouring element, materials are wanting from which to prepare a
notice adapted to do full justice to his merits.

Soon after his death, Rev. Samuel Willard, D. D., of Deerfield,
published in the Franklin Herald a brief but very just obituary notice
of him; and more recently Dr. Williams has prepared a memoir, which has
been transferred to his Medical Biography, from his address before the
Massachusetts Medical Society.

From these sources principally, the following facts have been obtained.

Dr. Wells was born in New York, in 1742; studied medicine partly under
the direction of Dr. Hull at Lebanon, Ct., and completed his medical
studies in New York, having made himself well acquainted with medical
science.

At the age of twenty-one, he commenced the practice of his profession
in New York, and according to the custom of that day, had under his
charge an apothecary's shop. After a short residence there, he removed
to Brattleborough, Vt., where he continued eighteen years, and acquired
an extensive practice and high reputation.

In the year 1782 he removed to Montague, with a view of obtaining a
more central situation as to his business, and, perhaps, to diminish
somewhat his labors in advancing life.

In 1785 he was elected a Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society;
and Dr. Williams states, that in 1806 he received the honorary degree
of M. D. from Dartmouth College, which may be a mistake, as his name
does not appear in the Triennial Catalogue.

In his profession, Dr. Wells attained the most distinguished rank. His
natural powers were good; his medical reading extensive and judicious;
his application methodical and patient. His eminent skill, however, in
the management of disease, was derived chiefly from his own observation
and experience. Possessing a clear and discriminating mind and an
accurate judgment, his practical deductions were remarkably just. In
difficult cases, his advice was much sought and highly appreciated.
Punctual in his professional engagements, courteous in his manners,
modest and unassuming in his intercourse with his medical brethren, he
was highly respected by the profession and the public.

As a man, he was much beloved. He professed a firm belief in the
gospel, and was much attached to the moral and religious institutions
of his country. He was a pattern of temperance; his general influence
was salutary; and his example such as might be safely imitated.

He was a kind husband and father. He was not exempt from domestic
affliction, three of his children being deaf mutes.

In the latter years of his life, he suffered much from disease, which
he bore with exemplary resignation, and, having passed the allotted
period of human life, died August 24, 1814, at the age of 72; leaving
behind him that _good name_ which is _better than precious ointment_.


V.--DR. GRIDLEY THAXTER OF ABINGTON.

He was a native of Hingham; born in 1756; studied medicine with his
brother, Dr. Thomas Thaxter of Hingham; and was a surgeon on board some
armed vessels during the Revolutionary war.

About the year 1780, he settled in Abington, and as a physician for
more than half a century enjoyed a very extensive practice. He probably
rode more miles, and visited more patients, than any other physician
who ever resided in the county of Plymouth.

He retained his faculties in very vigorous exercise until within a few
years of his death, when he became superannuated, and suffered under
alienation of mind, probably in consequence of bodily injury occasioned
by a fall.

He was remarkable for his iron constitution and power of endurance. He
rarely used a carriage in making his professional visits, preferring to
ride on horseback as long as he was able to attend to business.

In his habits he was frugal and temperate, never using distilled
liquors, not merely from choice, but from necessity, they being
extremely offensive and odious to him.

He was much beloved by his patients; was an estimable citizen, and
worthy man. His professional charges were moderate, especially for
attendance on persons in straitened circumstances.

He was a pleasant companion; a kind father, and fast friend.

His first wife was the daughter of Gen. Benjamin Lincoln of Hingham, by
whom he had a numerous family.

Ezekiel Thaxter, M. D., (H. C., 1812,) now resident in Abington, is his
son.

He died Feb. 10, 1845, aged 89.


VI.--DR. EZEKIEL DODGE CUSHING, OF HANOVER.

Dr. Cushing, a classmate and personal friend of the writer, was
descended from

1. Mathew Cushing, a son of Peter Cushing of Norfolk, Eng., who was
born in 1588, and in 1638 came to Boston, in the ship Diligent, with
his wife and five children; namely, Daniel, Jeremiah, Matthew, Deborah,
and _John_2. They settled at Hingham in the autumn of that year.
Matthew Cushing died at Hingham in 1660; his widow survived to 1681,
aged 96.

2. John Cushing{2} was born in England, in 1627, married Sarah, daughter
of Nicholas Jacob, and settled in Scituate. He was many years a deputy
in the Colony Court, and Representative to the Court at Boston after
the Colonies were united, in 1692 and several succeeding years. He died
1708, and his wife in 1678.

3. John Cushing{3}, son of the above, was born 1662, and died 1737. He
was Chief-Justice of the Inferior Court of Plymouth, from 1710 to 1728;
and Judge of the Supreme Court, from 1728 to the time of his decease.
John Cotton says, "he was the life and soul of the Court." He married
Deborah Loring of Hull, in 1687, who died 1713. Their children were
Sarah, Deborah, John, _Elijah_4, Mary, Nazareth, Benjamin, Nathaniel.

4. Elijah Cushing{4}, settled in Pembroke, and married Elisabeth Barker,
1724. They had sons, Elijah, _Nathaniel_5, Joseph, (H. C., 1752,) and
daughters, Mary, wife of Gen. Benjamin Lincoln, Deborah, wife of Rev.
Dr. Shute, and Elisabeth, wife of Major Cushing, all of Hingham.

5. Nathaniel Cushing{5} had sons, _Nathaniel_6, Benjamin, and Charles.

6. Nathaniel Cushing{6}, Esq., father of the subject of this Notice,
resided at Pembroke, now Hanson; married Mary, daughter of Rev. Ezekiel
Dodge of Abington, who graduated at H. C., 1749, and died 1770, aged
48. Their children were _Ezekiel Dodge_7, Mehetabel, Lucy, George, and
Elijah.

7. Ezekiel Dodge Cushing{7}, was born in 1790; graduated at Harvard
University, in 1808; commenced the study of medicine under the tuition
of Dr. Gad Hitchcock, of his native town; and after one year, became a
pupil of Dr. Nathan Smith, Professor in the Medical School of Dartmouth
College, where he received the degree of Bachelor in Medicine, in 1811.

His education was extended by attendance on the Hospitals and Lectures
in Philadelphia. He then visited London and Paris; in the former
city, acting as a dresser in St. Thomas' Hospital, while attending
the Lectures of Abernethy, Sir Astley Cooper, and others; and in the
latter, was present when it was occupied by the allies, witnessing
daily in the crowded hospitals a most extensive surgical practice.

Thus furnished for the practical duties of his profession, he returned
to his native country and settled in Boston, where he acquired the
reputation of an able and successful physician, and obtained a
respectable circle of business.

After a few years, perhaps being too impatient "to bide his time,"
and desirous of pursuing a more active life, he removed to Hanover,
where his services were much sought, and highly appreciated in a
widely extended circle. He was frequently called to advise with his
professional brethren in cases of difficulty, and to them as well as
to his employers, his opinions gave great satisfaction. It could not
well be otherwise, for he possessed eminent skill and tact in his
profession, and with it that urbanity and kindness of manner, which
secured the confidence of all with whom he had intercourse.

Just as his reputation had become established, and when his prospects
for long life and extended usefulness appeared most fair, he was
smitten with disease, appearing first in the form of an epileptic
affection, and then of partial paralysis, which issued in an entire
loss of tone in the digestive organs, and ultimately terminated in his
death, on the fifth of April, 1828, at the age of 38.

Thus died an amiable man and accomplished physician. Possessing
naturally a vigorous constitution, he probably in early life exposed
himself to unnecessary dangers; and when disease fastened upon him its
iron grasp, relying too much on his former experience, he failed to
exercise that care in his own case, which he would have recommended to
others in like circumstances. His memory will be cherished by all who
knew him, and his virtues may well be emulated by every aspirant to
honest fame, in the profession of which he was an ornament.

He married Delia Sawyer, daughter of Capt.---- Sawyer of Boston, and
left seven children; all of whom, except two who died young, with
their widowed mother survive to mourn his early death.

The following lines of his Epitaph, written by one who knew him well,
are remarkably just.

    "Where'er the scenes of woe were laid,
      His presence brightened hope and health;
    Enough for him that duty bade,
      Without the _line_ of sordid wealth."

D., in the Communications of the Massachusetts Medical Society, Vol. IV.

REV. ETHAN SMITH OF BOYLSTON, MS.


Ethan Smith was born in Belchertown, Ms., Dec. 19, 1762, and while
young, was a soldier for one summer in the Revolutionary war, and
was at West Point when the traitor Arnold sold that fortress to the
British. Having attended to the preparatory studies, he entered
Dartmouth College in 1786, and graduated in 1790. Soon after taking his
degree, Mr. Smith was licensed to preach, and spent the first Sabbath
of October, 1790, at Haverhill, N. H., where he was first settled

Society. He was afterwards settled at Hebron, N. Y., about four years;
at Poultney, Vt., about five years; at Hanover, Ms., a number of years;
and then spent a season as a city missionary in Boston. Occasionally,
he has since preached as a supply, but has now retired from the labors
of the ministry, and resides with his children. Mr. Smith has always
been a laborious, and, in many respects, a very successful minister
of Christ. His publications are as follows; namely, 1. A Dissertation
on the Prophecies, 2 editions; 2. A View of the Trinity, 2 editions;
3. A View of the Hebrews, 2 editions; 4. Lectures on the Subjects
and Mode of Baptism, 2 editions; 5. A Key to the Figurative Language

The Genealogy of this branch of the Smith family is as follows;
namely, Joseph Smith removed from Wethersfield, Ct., to Hadley, Ms.,
about the year 1659. He had four sons, who lived to maturity; namely,
Joseph, _John_, Jonathan, and Benjamin. _John_ was born 1686, settled

and had by her six sons and three daughters. He served as Captain in
the French war, in 1756, under Gen. William Johnson, in the Regiment
of Col. Ephraim Williams. He was deacon of the church in Belchertown,
Ms., and died April 21, 1770. He was "a man," says Rev. Mr. Forward,
in the Church Records, "of sound judgment, ready utterance, pleasing
deportment, and ardent piety." His children were Asa, father of Rev.
Asa Smith of Virginia, and Rev. Theophilus Smith of New Canaan, Ct.;
Sibil, wife of the late Joseph Bardwell of South Hadley, Ms.; Sarah,

REV. ASA RAND OF PETERBOROUGH, N. Y.

Asa Rand was born at Rindge, N. H., August 6, 1783, being the youngest
son and ninth child of Col. Daniel and Mrs. Susanna Rand. Daniel Rand
was the eldest son of Solomon Rand, of Shrewsbury, Ms., who married a
daughter of the Rev. Mr. Dodge of Abington, Ms. Solomon's father also
resided in Shrewsbury, and married a daughter of Capt. Keyes of that
place; who, in the early settlement of the town, lost his unfinished
house by fire, when his two sons, a hired man, and a journeyman joiner
perished in the flames. Mrs. Susanna Rand was the only daughter of
Daniel Hemmenway, also of Shrewsbury. Col. Rand was one of the early
settlers of the town of Rindge, where he ever resided after his
marriage, in 1767. He died in 1811, aged 69. The ancestors of both the
parents of the subject of this Sketch, it is believed, were emigrants
from England; but their genealogy we can trace no farther back with
certainty.

After enjoying the usual advantages of a common school, Mr. Rand
prepared for college principally at Chesterfield Academy, New
Hampshire, under the instruction of Hon. Levi Jackson. He entered the
Sophomore Class in September, 1803, and was graduated at Dartmouth
College, in 1806. After leaving college, he taught the children of
the Hon. Elijah Paine and a few others, at Williamstown, Vt., about
nine months; studied theology with Rev. Dr. Burton of Thetford,
seven months; and in January, 1808, received the approbation of an
association as a preacher of the gospel.

He preached several months in 1808 to the Congregational church and
society in Gorham, Me., which were in a state of serious and alarming
division. Having received a unanimous invitation from both, he was
ordained their minister Jan. 18, 1809; where he was favored with a
prosperous and happy ministry during thirteen years. His health,
however, was precarious for the greater part of that time, and in June,
1822, he resigned the charge of an affectionate and united people to a
successor, believing that his work as a public speaker was done.

In August, 1822, he took the editorial charge of the Christian Mirror,
on its first establishment at Portland, Me., Mr. Arthur Shirley
being proprietor and publisher. In July, 1825, finding his health
still suffering on the sea-coast, he removed to the interior of
Massachusetts, and took charge of the new Female Seminary at Brookfield.

In July, 1826, he succeeded Gerard Hallock, as co-editor and
co-proprietor with Nathaniel Willis, of the Boston Recorder; Dea.
Willis having the charge of the printing and publishing, and Mr. Rand
of the editorial department. He was also acting-editor of the Youth's
Companion and Education Reporter, published by the same company; each
being the earliest paper of its kind established in the country. On
leaving the Recorder, in 1831, Mr. Rand continued the Reporter till it
was transferred to William C. Woodbridge and united with the Annals
of Education. He was also publisher and principal conductor of the
Volunteer, a monthly religious magazine; which, at the end of two
years, was united with the Evangelical Magazine, at Hartford, Ct.

In April, 1833, Mr. Rand removed to Lowell; where he had a connection
with a bookstore and printing office, and the publication of the Lowell
Observer, a weekly religious paper, which was subsequently transferred
to Mr. Porter, publisher of the N. E. Spectator at Boston.

On the restoration of his health, he returned in 1835 to his chosen
employment of public preaching. He lectured in the employment of
anti-slavery societies in Cumberland county, Maine, and the counties
of Hampshire and Hampden, Massachusetts. From September, 1837, he
ministered to the Congregational church in Pompey, N. Y., five years;
and is now preaching to the Presbyterian church in Peterboro, Madison
Co., N. Y.

Mr. Rand was married in November, 1812, to Grata Payson, eldest
daughter of Rev. Seth Payson, D. D., of Rindge; who died suddenly
at Gorham, April 29, 1818. Feb. 8, 1820, he was married to Clarissa
Thorndike, daughter of Nicholas Thorndike, Esq., of Beverly, Ms.;
who died at Portland, July 7, 1825. July 6, 1826, he married Mary
Coolidge, widow of Elisha Coolidge, merchant, of Boston, and daughter
of Rev. John Cushing, D. D., of Ashburnham, Ms. His third wife is still
living; also her only son by her first husband, Elisha T. Coolidge, of
Cincinnati, O.

The children of Mr. Rand's first wife were three; namely, a son, who
died on the day of his birth; Harriet Newell, who united with the
church in Lowell, was principal of the female department in Pompey
Academy several years, became, in January, 1841, the second wife of
Rev. Russell S. Cook, one of the Secretaries of the Am. Tract Society
at New York, and died suddenly in February, 1843; William Wilberforce,
who was educated at the Public Latin School in Boston, Bowdoin College,
and Bangor Theological Seminary. He was four years pastor of the
Reformed Dutch Church at Canastota, Madison Co., N. Y., and is now
preaching in Maine. He married Marcia S. Dunning, of Brunswick, Me.; of
whom, with her two children, it has pleased God to bereave him.

By his second wife Mr. Rand had also three children, who are all
living. Thorndike is a clerk in the Suffolk bank, Boston, and married
Hannah P. Nourse of Beverly. Charles Asa is clerk in a bookstore at St.
Louis, Mo. Anna Thorndike is the wife of John F. Nourse, Principal of
Beverly Academy.

While Mr. Rand resided at Gorham, a quarterly religious Magazine was
published at Portland, of which David Thurston, Edward Payson, Asa
Rand, and Francis Brown were joint conductors. In the "day of small
things" among the churches of Maine, it did good. It was published five
years, from 1814 to 1818, inclusive.

The publications of Mr. Rand are, a Sermon to Children; a Sermon
at the Ordination of Rev. Francis Brown at North Yarmouth, Jan.
11, 1810; a Sermon before the Maine Missionary Society, 1815; two
Sermons on Christian Fellowship; "A Word in Season in behalf of the
Holy Scriptures," (reviewing Quaker principles;) a pamphlet on the
Controversies in the First Church of North Yarmouth; a volume entitled
"Familiar Sermons"; a review of Finney's Sermon on making a New Heart,
entitled "New Divinity tried"; a "Vindication of the same, in reply to
Rev. Dr. Wisner"; and a "Letter to Rev. Dr. Beecher, in relation to his
ministerial course in Boston."


HON. OLIVER WENDELL OF BOSTON.

Oliver Wendell was born in Boston, March 5, 1733, [N. S.] His father,
Hon. Jacob Wendell, was born in Albany in 1691, and was a descendant of
the first of the name and family in America, that has been transmitted
to us. Evart Janson Wendell came from Embden[X] to the New Netherlands
when possessed by the Dutch, and settled at Beverwyck, the site of
Fort Orange, afterward called Albany, on Hudson river. The arms of the
family were painted on nine panes of glass in the east window of the
ancient church in Albany; namely, a ship riding at her two anchors. By
an engraved copy of these arms, in possession of the family, it appears
that Evart Janson Wendell was an officer in that church the same year
in which New Amsterdam, afterwards called New York, was laid out in
small streets eight years before the Dutch garrison at Fort Orange
capitulated to the English. The inscription is, _Regerendo Dijakin_,
1656.

Evart J. was the father of John, who was the father of Jacob. This
grandson of Evart J., the father of Oliver, was placed, while in his
minority, under the care of Mr. John Mico, an eminent merchant in
Boston, and was trained up to mercantile business. He afterwards became
settled in Boston as a merchant, and was very prosperous. He was highly
respected in the town and province; and, among other offices, was
repeatedly employed by the government in the negotiation of treaties,
and exchange of prisoners, with the Indians. He married Sarah Oliver,
the daughter of Dr. James Oliver of Cambridge, and lived in School
street, near the Episcopal church. He possessed a handsome estate in
Oliver street, where, after the destructive fire of 1760, he built a
brick house, (still standing,) in which his son Oliver lived. Since the
incorporation of the city, a street leading from Oliver street, and
passing by this place, has been named Wendell street. Mr. Wendell had
several children. His son Oliver, after finishing his education at
Harvard College, entered into mercantile business with his father, from
whose experience and counsels he may have derived no less benefit, than
from his stock in trade.

Mr. Wendell possessed a rare combination of talents and virtues,
alike adapted to the offices of public and of private life. Mild in
temper, benevolent in disposition, upright in principle, and resolute
in action, he was conciliatory in address, and exemplary in life; and
uniformly had the esteem and confidence of his friends and of the
community. He was in the consultations of the early patriots of the
American Revolution, and contributed to the acquisition and maintenance
of the liberty and independence of the Commonwealth and country. After
the Constitution was settled, he was often a member of the Senate,
and of the Council, in the government of the Commonwealth. During
his public life, he was Judge of Probate for the county of Suffolk;
President of Union Bank; a Fellow of the Corporation of Harvard
College; President of the Society for propagating the Gospel among the
Indians and others in North America; and a Trustee of Phillips Academy,
Andover. Retiring from the city, he spent several of his last years in
Cambridge, where he died, January 15, 1818, aged 85.

The evening of his days was serene and tranquil. While conscious of
uprightness, he relied not on his integrity as meritorious, but founded
his hope of future happiness on the propitiation made for sin by
Jesus Christ; this hope was a steadfast anchor to his soul. Religious
contemplation, and devotional exercises, habitual to him in public and
active life, were cherished by him in secrecy and the stillness of
retirement. Easy and gentle, at last, was his descent to the grave,
and the observer might "see in what peace a Christian can die." His
remains were deposited in the family tomb, in the Chapel burial-ground
in Boston.

To the public notice of his death was annexed the following sketch
of his character, written in the Council Chamber at the State House,
on the reception of the intelligence of his death, by a highly
respected friend,[Y] who, by long intercourse with him in public
and private life, was a competent judge of his character. "In all
relations of life, as a man, citizen, and magistrate, Judge Wendell
was distinguished for uncommon urbanity of manners, and unimpeached
integrity of conduct. During the course of a long life he had been
successively called to fill many high and responsible offices. The
punctuality and precision with which he fulfilled all the duties
connected with them, were highly exemplary. Full of years, he has
descended to the grave regretted and beloved by all who knew him;
happy in the consciousness of a life well spent, and rejoicing in the
prospect of felicity in a future state, of which a firm faith in his
Redeemer gave him the assurance."

Judge Wendell married, in 1762, Mary, a daughter of Edward Jackson, who
graduated at H. C. 1726, married Dorothy Quincy, and was a merchant of
Boston. He was the son of Jonathan, who was a brazier and nail-maker,
and married Mary Salter, March 26, 1700, lived in Boston, and left
an estate of about £30,000. He was the son of Jonathan, who married
Elizabeth---- and settled in Boston. He was born in England, and was
the son of Edward, born in 1602, who emigrated from White Chapel, a
parish in London, to this country about 1642, took the freeman's oath,
May, 1645, and in 1646 purchased of Gov. Bradstreet a farm of 500 acres
of land in that part of Cambridge which is now Newton, for £140. For
his second wife he married March 14, 1648, Elisabeth Oliver, widow of
Rev. John Oliver, the first minister of Rumney Marsh, (Chelsea,) and
daughter of John Newgate of Boston. He was one of the most respectable
men of the Colony, and was much engaged in public life. He died July
17, 1681, aged 79. Judge Wendell had several children, most of whom
died young. Oliver and Edward never married, and have deceased. Sarah
married the Rev. Dr. Abiel Holmes of Cambridge, by whom she had five
children; namely, Mary Jackson, who married Usher Parsons, M. D., of
Providence, R. I.; Ann Susan, who married Rev. Charles W. Upham of
Salem; Sarah Lathrop, who died 1812, aged 6 years; Oliver Wendell, M.
D., of Boston, who married Amelia Lee Jackson, daughter of Hon. Charles
Jackson of Boston; and John, an Attorney at law, living in Cambridge.

For the above facts we are indebted principally to the late Rev. Dr.
Holmes of Cambridge, and Francis Jackson, Esq., of Boston.


HON. JONATHAN LAW, GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT.

    [The facts in this Memoir were obtained through the obliging
    instrumentality of Prof. Kingsley of Yale College.]

Jonathan Law, Governor of the Colony of Connecticut, descended from
Richard Law, who came from England in the year 1640, and was one of
the first settlers in the town of Stamford, Ct., in 1641. He left one
son, Richard, who afterwards moved to Milford in that State, where his
son Jonathan, his only son and the subject of this Memoir, was born,
Aug. 6, 1674. His mother was Sarah, daughter of George Clark, Sen., a
planter. He was educated at Harvard College, then the only Academical
Institution in New England, and received his degree of Bachelor of
Arts in 1695. The law was the profession which he selected, and after
passing through the course of studies usual at that period, he was
admitted to the bar, and fixed his residence in his native town in
1698. He soon became distinguished as a lawyer and an advocate, and
after a few years was made Chief-Judge of New Haven County Court. This
office he held for five years, and in May, 1715, he was transferred to
the Bench of the Superior Court of the Colony, as one of the Associate
Judges, where he continued, with the exception of one year, till 1725.
At the annual election in 1717, he was chosen an Assistant, an office
of great trust and importance, being ex officio a Legislator, a member
of the Governor's Council, and a judicial Magistrate throughout the
Colony. This station he resigned in 1725, on his election to the
office of Lieutenant-Governor, and the same year he was appointed by
the General Assembly CHIEF-JUSTICE of the Superior Court, both which
offices he held until the year 1742; when he was elected Governor, and
continued in that office until his death, which, after a short and
painful sickness of three days, occurred at Milford, Nov. 6, 1750, at
the age of 76 years. He left seven sons and a widow, his fifth wife.

A funeral Oration in Latin was delivered on the occasion in the chapel
of Yale College, by Mr. Stiles, then senior Tutor in that Institution,
and afterwards its distinguished President. It portrays in the most
glowing colors, the mild virtues of his private life, and the singular
success of his public administration.

During this period, there was a time when religious dissensions, which
originated in the excessive zeal of itinerant preachers, had made their
way into sober and regular ecclesiastical communities, by which means
they were greatly disturbed, and the Colony was convulsed almost to its
centre.

Early in the eighteenth century, a wonderful attention to religion
had been excited in various parts of Connecticut. It seems to have
been a genuine revival, not unmingled, perhaps, with some slight alloy
of enthusiasm. Soon after this the celebrated Mr. Whitefield, whose
sincere and honest piety Cowper has immortalized in the most glowing
colors, whose eloquence vanquished on one occasion even Franklin's
philosophical caution, after preaching with the greatest applause and
effect, at the South, came to New England at the pressing invitations
of the clergymen of Boston. On his return, he passed through
Connecticut, where the people crowded to hear him, and sunk under the
weight of his powerful Christian eloquence. His example seems to have
been followed by others of weaker intellect and less judgment; by
men, who mistook the illusions of their own minds, for the operations
of the Holy Spirit. There was particularly a Mr. Davenport of Long
Island, who had been a sound and faithful minister, but, unfortunately,
partook of the same spirit, and by his precepts and example, encouraged
the wildest extravagances of sentiment and conduct. Some of the "New
Lights," (as they were called,) boldly proclaimed their intimate
communion with the Almighty, in raptures, ecstacies, trances, and
visions. A few of the clergy were not free from these errors, and
forsook their own charge to labor in the vineyards of others. In some
counties, lay-preachers sprang up, who pretended to divine impulses and
inward impressions, and professed a supernatural power of discerning
between those that were converted, and those that were not. Confusion
prevailed at their meetings, and instead of checking these unseemly
disorders, the leaders labored to increase and extend them. Such
excesses threw a shade on real piety, and threatened to subvert the
foundations of pure and genuine Christianity throughout the Colony.
The Legislature, between whom and the church there was then a much
closer connection than at this day, in consequence of the numerous
applications made to them for their interference and protection,
enacted laws, the severity of which was not justifiable, but may, in
some measure, be palliated when we consider the magnitude of the evil.
A heated zeal and a misguided conscience, rather, perhaps, than a
contempt of the authority of government, gave rise in some counties to
loud murmurs and great dissatisfaction.

Governor Law, although an ardent friend of the gospel system in its
original purity, opposed with all the energy he possessed, this wild
spirit of fanaticism. To him was its suppression, in no small degree,
to be attributed. With the skill of an experienced pilot, he kept
his eye always fixed on the star of civil and religious liberty, and
steered the political bark unhurt, amidst the dangers that surrounded
it. It was to these troubles that President Stiles alluded in the
Eulogy before spoken of, when, after paying a just compliment to his
predecessors, he adds:

    "_Sed gloria Conservandæ reipublicæ ac perite per procellas
    intestinas periculosissimasque confusiones fortiter et clementer
    administrandæ sit soli sapienti et illustrissimo_ LAW."

It was during this term of service, likewise, that the expedition
against Cape Breton was undertaken. The plan was formed by Gov. SHIRLEY
of Massachusetts, and was executed by raw, undisciplined troops,
ignorant of the arts of regular warfare, with the most brilliant
success. He saw the great importance of this enterprise, and labored,
with unwearied industry, to prevent its failure.

Governor Law was unquestionably a man of high talents and
accomplishments, both natural and acquired. He was well acquainted with
civil and ecclesiastical subjects, and gradually rose, by the force of
his own exertions, to the highest honors of the State. He was of a mild
and placid temper, amiable in all the relations of domestic life, and
seems to have well discharged the duties imposed on him.

    First-love is pure without a stain,
    The heart can never fondly love again;
    One holy shrine will in the bosom rest,

    True love's a steady, bright, unchanging ray,
    And not the idle preference of a day;
    A fadeless flower which will for ever bloom
    Through years, in absence, and beyond the tomb.

DR. WATTS'S LETTER OF CONDOLENCE TO MADAM SEWALL.


    [The following letter of Dr. Watts was written to Madam Sewall,
    the wife of Maj. Samuel Sewall, a highly accomplished merchant of
    Boston, upon the sudden and affecting death of her two sons. These
    were children by her first husband, Mr. Nathan Howell, and her only
    children, for she never had any by Maj. Sewall. For the letter and
    a number of the facts in relation to the sad event, we are indebted
    to Charles Ewer, Esq.; and through his instrumentality also the
    likenesses of the youth drowned were procured from Mrs. Loring, the
    wife of Henry Loring, Esq., of this city, and are now deposited
    in the Rooms of the New England Historic, Genealogical Society.
    The Rev. Samuel Sewall of Burlington informs us that the Rev. Dr.
    Sewall of the Old South Church, in his diary, notices the event as
    follows: "1727-8 January 8, (Monday,) George and Nathan Howell abt
    15 & 14 yrs old, went a skating at the bottom of ye Common, and
    were both drowned. O Ld Sanctify this awful Providce to the near

    Nathan Howell and Katherine George were married by Rev. Dr. Colman,
    Aug. 11, 1708: George and Nathan, their sons, were born,--George,
    Nov. 1, 1712, and Nathan, March 21, 1713-14.

    In Pemberton's Manuscript Chronology we find the following entry:
    "1728, January 8th, George and Nathan Howell of Boston, brothers
    about 14 and 15 years old, in skating at the bottom of the Common,
    fell through the ice and were both drowned."]

                                                 _November 7, 1728._

  MADAM,

Yesterday from Mr Sewall's hand I Received the favor of several Letters
from my Friends in New-England, and a particular account of that
sharp and surprising Stroak of Providence that has made a painful and
lasting Wound on your Soul. He desir'd a Letter from my hand directed
to you which might carry in it some Balm for an afflicted spirit. By
his Information I find that I am not an utter stranger to your Family
and Kindred. Mr Lee your Venerable Grandfather was Predecessor to Mr
Thomas Rowe my Honour'd Tutor and once my Pastor in my younger years.
Mr Peacock who married your eldest Aunt was my intimate Friend. Mrs
Bishop and Mrs Wirly were both my Acquaintance tho' my long Illness and
Absence from London has made me a stranger to their Posterity whom I
knew when Children. But now I know not who of them are living or where.
Docr Cotton Mather your late Father in Law was my yearly Correspondent,
and I lament the loss of him. But the loss you have sustained is of a
more tender and distressing kind; yet let us see whether there are not
sufficient Springs of Consolation flowing round you to allay the smart
of so great a sorrow. And may the Lord open your Eyes as he did the
Eyes of Hagar in the Wilderness so to Espy the Spring of Water when she
was dying with Thirst and her Child over against her ready to expire.
Gen. 21, 19.

Have you lost two lovely Children? Did you make them your Idols? if you
did, God hath sav'd you from Idolatry; if you did not, you have your
God still and a Creature cannot be miserable who has a God. The short
words My God have infinitely more sweetness in them than My Sons or My
Daughters. Were they desirable Blessings? Your God calls you then to
the nobler Sacrifice. Can you give up these to him at his call? God
delighteth in such a Sacrifice. Were they your All? So was Isaac when
Abraham was required to part with him at God's Altar. Are not you a
Daughter of Abraham? Then imitate you his Faith, his self-denial, his
Obedience, and make your Evidences of such a Spiritual Relation to him
shine Brighter on this solemn occasion. Has God taken them from your
Arms? had you not given them to God before? had you not devoted them
to him in Baptism? are you displeas'd that God calls for his own? was
not your heart sincere in the Resignation of them to him? Show then,
Madam, the sincerity of your Heart in leaving of them in the Hand of
God--Do you say they are lost? not out of God's sight, and God's World,
tho' they are out of our sight and our World. All live to God. You may
hope the spreading Covenant of Grace has shelter'd them from the second
Death. They live tho' not with you. Are you ready to say you have
brought forth for the Grave? it may be so, but not in vain. Isaiah 65,
23. _They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble_; (that
is for Sorrow and without hope) _for they are the seed of the Blessed
of the Lord and their offspring with them_. This has been a sweet Text
to many a Mother when their Children have been called away betimes.
And the Prophet Jeremy Chap. 31, 15-17, has very comfortable words
to allay the same sorrow. Did you please yourself in what comforts
you might have derived from them in maturer years? But Madam, do you
consider sufficiently that God hath taken them away from the evil to
come, and hid them in the Grave from the prevailing and mischievous
Temptations of a degenerate age. My Brother's Wife in London has buried
seven or eight Children, and among them, all her Sons. This tho't has
reconciled her to the Providence of God, that the Temptations of young
men in this Age are so exceeding great, and she has seen so many young
Gentlemen of her acquaintance so shamefully degenerate, that she wipes
her Tears for the Sons she has buried, and composes herself to Patience
and Thankfulness with one only Daughter remaining. Perhaps God has by
this stroak prevented a thousand unknown Sorrows. Are your Sons dead?
but are your Mercies dead too? A worthy Husband is a living Comfort
and may God preserve and restore him to you in safety. Food, Raiment,
Safety, Peace, Liberty of Religious access to the mercy seat, Hope of
Heaven;--All these are daily matters of thankfullness. Good Madam, let
not one sorrow bury them all. Shew that you are a Christian by making
it appear that Religion has supports in it which the World doth not
enjoy and which the World doth not know. What can a poor Worldling do
but mourn over earthly Blessings departed, and go down comfortless
with them to the Grave. But methinks that a Christian should lift up
the Head as partaking of higher hopes. May the Blessed Spirit be your
Comforter. Endeavour Madam to employ yourself in some Business or
Amusement of life continually. Let not a solitary frame of Mind tempt
you to set Brooding over your Sorrows and nurse them up to a dangerous
Size; but turn your Thoughts often to the brighter Scenes of Heaven and
the Resurrection. Forgive the freedom of a stranger, Madam, who desires
to be the Humble and faithful Servant of Christ and Souls.

  Postscript.

Madam, You have so many excellent Comforters round about you that I
even Blush to send what I have wrote; yet since the narrowness of my
Paper has excluded two or three thoughts which may not be impertinent
or useless on this mournful Occasion I will insert them here. You know
Madam that the great and blessed God had but one Son, and he gave him
up a Sacrifice and devoted him to a bloody Death out of Love to such
Sinners as you and I. Can you shew your gratitude to God in a more
evident & acceptable manner than by resigning willingly your two Sons
to him at the call of his Providence? This Act of willing Resignation
will turn a painful Affliction into a holy Sacrifice. Are the two
dearest things torn from the heart of a Mother, then you may ever set
looser by this World, and you have the fewer dangerous Attachments
to this life. 'Tis a happiness for a Christian not to have the heart
strings tyed too fast to any thing beneath God and Heaven. Happy the
Soul that is ready to move at the Divine summons. The fewer Engagements
we have on earth, the more we may live above, and have our thoughts
more fixed on things Divine and heavenly. May this painful stroak thus
Sanctified lead you nearer to God. Amen.

"A boate going out of Hampton River was cast away and the psons all
drowned who were in number eight: Em. Hilliar, Jon. Philbrick and An
Philbrick his wife; Sarah Philbrick there daughter; Alice the wyfe of
Moses Cox and John Cox his sonne, Robert Read; who all perished in ye

From the same Records, we learn that "Capt. Benjamin Swett of Hampton
was slain at Black Point by the barbarous Indians the 29th June, 1677."

FAMILY INCREASE.


The following facts published in a note in Vol. II. of Haliburton's
"Historical and Statistical Account of Nova Scotia" are believed to be
unparalleled in the increase of any family on record. It can at once
be seen that at this rate of multiplying population it would take only
a short period to people the earth. Any one, curious enough to make
a calculation, will be astonished at the multitude of persons after
the lapse of a few generations which could trace their descent from a
common ancestor. The note is as follows:

"In the Spring of the year 1760, A. Smith, Esq., a native of Cape
Cod, landed at Barrington,[AA] for the purpose of making arrangements
for the reception of his family, but finding the Indians numerous, he
abandoned the idea of emigrating and returned home. Shortly after his
departure, his wife arrived in a vessel bound on a fishing voyage,
and was landed with her family. Here she remained five weeks, until
the arrival of her husband, during which time she was kindly and
hospitably treated by the Savages. She died at Barrington, in March,
1828, leaving at the time of her death 5 children, 56 grandchildren,
297 great-grandchildren, 64 of the fifth, and 1 of the sixth generation
living, exclusive of a daughter, in the United States, who had a large
family, and of several grandchildren who have removed from Barrington."

NOTICES OF NEW PUBLICATIONS.


_The Massachusetts State Record and Year Book of General Information.
1847. "Human and mortal although we are, we are nevertheless not mere
insulated beings, without relation to the past or future."_--DANIEL
WEBSTER. Boston: Published by James French, 78 Washington Street. 1847.

    This is the first volume of a new work, and is intended to be an
    Annual. It will aim, "1. To give annually the names of the State,
    County and Town Officers, and, in connection therewith, to note
    the objects and results of our State Legislation. 2. To develop
    the principles of the Institutions of the Commonwealth by giving
    their objects and results. 3. To set forth the kind and extent
    of business pursued by the inhabitants, including the learned
    professions. 4. To represent the social, moral, and physical
    condition of the people, as connected with their pursuits and
    recreation. 5. To exhibit the mutual relations of society, and to
    embody the results of the combined action of all in relation to
    external objects, with a view to the high destiny of man."

    The plan of the work is copious and judicious, and the due
    execution of it will require study, labor, and exactness. The
    present volume, which embraces two hundred and eighty pages,
    is printed on good paper with fair type, and is well bound. It
    contains a great quantity of matter, interesting and useful, and
    its historical character will render it none the less so. The
    editor we doubt not will exert himself to make the work deserving
    of public patronage.


_Biographical Sketches of the Moody Family; embracing notices of ten
Ministers and several Laymen, from 1633 to 1842._

    "_Just men they were, and all their study bent
    To worship God aright, and know his works
    Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve
    Freedom and peace to man._"

_By Charles C. P. Moody._ Boston: Published by Samuel G. Drake, No. 56
Cornhill. 1847.

    This 12mo volume of 168 pages, besides the introduction, contains
    a brief account of Rev. Joshua Moody, Portsmouth and Boston; Rev.
    Samuel Moody, Newcastle, N. H., and Falmouth, Me.; Rev. Samuel
    Moody, pastor of the First Church in York, Me.; Rev. Joshua Moody,
    Star Island, N. H.; Rev. Joseph Moody, pastor of the Second Church
    in York, Me.; Joshua Moody, Esq., Portland, Me.; Dr. Samuel
    Moody, Portland, Me.; Rev. John Moody, New Market, N. H.; Rev.
    Amos Moody, Pelham, N. H.; Mr. Enoch Moody, Portland, Me; Dea.
    Benjamin Moody, Newburyport; Rev. Samuel Moody, Principal of Dummer
    Academy; Rev. Silas Moody, Arundel, Me.; Mr. Paul Moody, Waltham
    and Lowell; Stephen Moody, Esq., Gilmanton, N. H.; Joseph Moody,
    Esq., Kennebunk, Me.; Rev. Eli Moody, Granby, Ms.; and a List of
    all the Graduates at the New England Colleges by the name of Moody,
    in number 39. The united ages of the seventeen persons noticed
    in these sketches amount to 1,142 years, averaging 67 years to
    each--the eldest being 82, and the youngest 50 years. Mr. William
    Moody the principal progenitor of the name in New England, came,
    according to the most authentic accounts, from Wales, England, to
    Ipswich in 1633, and removed to Newbury with the first settlers in
    1635. While this work is affectingly serious, some portions of it
    partake of the character of novelty. No one can read the notices of
    Rev. Joshua Moody of Portsmouth and Boston, and of "Father Moody,"
    "Handkerchief Moody," and "Master Moody," as they were called,
    without being deeply interested. We hope the volume will meet with
    a ready sale, and be perused with spiritual benefit.


_A Sermon[AB] delivered at Plymouth on the twenty-second of December,
1846. By Mark Hopkins, D. D., President of Williams College._ Boston:
Press of T. R. Marvin, 24 Congress Street. 1847.

    The text on which this discourse is based is contained in Matt.
    xxiii.: 8. "And all ye are brethren."

    After the exordium and stating what is indicated in that
    far-reaching annunciation of the text, _And all ye are brethren_,
    the President says, "Columbus sought a passage to the Indies,
    and God revealed to him the whole rounded inheritance which he
    created in the beginning, and intended for the use of civilized
    man. Our Fathers sought for religious freedom, and God led them
    on to the practical recognition of those principles laid down
    by Christ in accordance with which alone man can obtain that
    political and social and moral inheritance of which his nature is
    evidently capable, and which we believe God intended for him." The
    term brethren indicates equality and affection, and these must
    form the basis of a perfect society. This proposition Dr. Hopkins
    shows is sanctioned by the Scriptures, and is in accordance with
    the nature of man. Having proved and illustrated the proposition,
    he urges upon the descendants of the Puritans to adopt this and
    this alone as the basis of our institutions, and to carry out
    this great principle of brotherhood. We conclude the notice of
    this appropriate and excellent discourse, by quoting the closing
    address: "And now, my friends, is not the star of hope which we
    see in this direction, a beautiful star? It is no meteor of a
    fervid imagination, or of a false philosophy. It is that great
    idea of a universal Christian brotherhood, pointed out by Christ,
    not in the text only, but everywhere, as an inherent part of his
    system. This star our Fathers saw, and is it any wonder, that under
    its inspiration and guidance, they should come across the ocean?
    Literally they found a landing here, but figuratively, the vessel
    which they launched is yet upon the deep, the multitude of their
    descendants is on board, and we too catch glimpses of the same
    bright star above the troubled waters. It may be that this vessel
    is not destined to reach the port. We hear moanings of the tempest,
    and see aspects of the elements which lead us to tremble for her.
    But where the bright image of this star has once fallen, it can
    never be effaced. This is our star. To it let the prow of our
    vessel be turned. Let every man be at his post, never ashamed of
    the plain rigging of his good ship, but always hearing that voice
    of duty, and of the God of our Fathers, which will speak above the
    roar of every tempest; and then if our ship must go down, the will
    of God be done. But _then_ she will not go down. Then the hand
    which guided the Mayflower, will guide her. Then will there be One
    on board, as we believe there always has been, who, though he may
    seem for a time to be asleep in the hinder part of the ship, will
    yet come, when the winds are loudest, and the waves are highest,
    and say, 'Peace, be still.'"


_The Connecticut Register: Being an official State Calendar of public
officers and institutions in Connecticut, for 1847. By Charles
W. Bradley, Jr., clerk in the office of the Secretary of State._
"Vineam---- transtulisti, ejecisti gentes et plantasti eam. Dux
itineris fuisti in conspectu ejus; plantasti radices ejus, et implevit
terram. Operuit montes umbra ejus, et arbusta ejus cedros Dei.
Extendit, palmites suos usque ad mare, et usque ad flumen propagines
ejus."--Ps. LXXX. Hartford: Published by Brown & Parsons, Corner of
Main and Asylum Streets.

    This volume of 224 pages 16mo, well printed and bound, for a
    work of the kind, embraces much more Historical and Statistical
    matter than is usual in such publications; as the chapter which
    contains the Annals of Connecticut, the Patent and Charter of the
    Colony, Indian topographical names till now never extensively
    collected, list of Colonial officers, and dates of town and court
    incorporations. The difficulty which has heretofore existed in
    tracing out genealogies from the records of the Mortuary Courts,
    is in part obviated by the table of their territorial changes.
    The author, connected as he was, with the records of the State,
    possessed peculiar advantages in preparing the work. The Register
    contains all the above articles in addition to those which have
    generally been inserted in its predecessors. It is a valuable book,
    and should be in the hands of every family in the State.

       *       *       *       *       *

publications which we have received. We shall give notices of them in
the next number of the Register.


EXTRACTS FROM NOTICES OF THE NEW ENGLAND HISTORICAL AND GENEALOGICAL
REGISTER.

The object of this work is to gather up the facts which relate to the
Fathers of New England, so that the present generation may distinctly
understand, that "God sifted a whole nation that he might send choice
grain over into this wilderness." It will also contain the genealogy
of families which early settled the country. It will not be sectarian
in its character, but will be a faithful record of the principles and
character of the founders of New England. Among the great number of new
publications that are striving to push themselves into the community,
this cannot fail to find its way into the study of the minister, the
office of the lawyer and physician, and the parlor of many thousands of
the descendants of the Pilgrims.--_Boston Recorder._

It is a unique magazine. The work will bring to light many amusing
personal incidents both of old times and new. It must be intensely
interesting to all New England men, especially those who have a taste
for such things and have descended in regular succession from the
Pilgrims.--_Journal of Commerce, New York._

The first Number of the work has just made its appearance, and we greet
it with a hearty welcome. We commend it to all interested in pursuing
inquiries of a historical or statistical nature relating to New
England.--_Boston Atlas._

It is the only work of the kind ever undertaken in this country. Both
the Editor and Publisher come to their task with a degree of experience
and tact on such matters which will commend their labors to the
confidence of all interested in this kind of investigation.--_Vermont
Chronicle._

If we rightly apprehend the design of this work it will be serviceable
to the community in gathering and presenting the elements of the
history of New England. Dr. Cogswell has for a long course of years
employed his mind much in labors of this sort, and his efforts have
been well appreciated. He seems now to be more exclusively devoted
to them, and with advantages of doing the work more effectually. We
confidently commend this work to those who have a taste for such
reading, and those who wish to encourage and patronize a work, which
must be of great value to the coming generation.--_New England Puritan._

The comprehensive design of this work appears to be well carried out
in the number before us, which contains a great amount of historical,
statistical, and genealogical information.--_Lowell Daily Courier._

It is pleasant to take a peep at the queer and musty antiquities of
the Western world through the clear glass of such clean and beautiful
pages of modern typography. To those, heirs apparent or expectant, of
English or French estates, the work has some charms of an interesting
character.--_Massachusetts Cataract._

Its contents give promise of a periodical of great interest, especially
to New England men and women, who would be better acquainted with their
fathers.--_Christian Observer, Philadelphia._

The Rev. Dr. Cogswell, its Editor, was for some time connected with the
American Quarterly Register, and more recently with the New Hampshire
Repository, both of which were more or less devoted to subjects kindred
to those of which this work proposes exclusively to treat, and his
name alone is a sufficient guaranty for the faithful management of
a historical and genealogical journal. The Publisher, Mr. Drake, a
thorough antiquary, and well known as the historian of the Indians, is
admirably qualified to discharge the duties he has just assumed.--_New
York Express._

We are glad to see the commencement of a Quarterly Periodical of this
character in New England. Under the care of Dr. Cogswell, well known
for his historical, antiquarian, and genealogical lore, it will become
a repository of rare and valuable facts, a record of events, the memory
of which should be dear to the descendants of the Pilgrims.--_Boston
Mercantile Journal._

This is an excellent work, just such an one as we have long
needed.--_Litchfield Inquirer, Ct._


NOTICES.

->We propose to publish in some future Nos. of the Register brief
Genealogical Memoirs of all the Signers of the Declaration of
Independence. We request, therefore, that, if any of the relatives or
friends of these individuals have in their possession any genealogical
or biographical accounts of them, or can furnish any, they will be
pleased to send them to the Editor of this work. It is especially
desired that the communications should be accurate in their facts--as
names, dates, places, &c., and the chirography be very legible. The
names and places of residence of the individuals who may be pleased to
transmit such papers should be given as vouchers for their correctness.

Any person who will copy and send to the Cor. Sec. of the N. E. H. and
G. Society, exact copies of the earliest births, deaths, and marriages
from town records, or any other source, will confer an obligation
on the community; as they will be deposited in the archives of the
Society, and be published from time to time in the Register. The
account should be written legibly, and the name of the copyist and his
place of residence should be given as authority for the same.

->We would give notice that Horatio G. Somerby, Esq., of Boston, will
visit England this season for the purpose of investigating the early
genealogies of the emigrants to New England, if suitable pecuniary
encouragement should be given by those who may be interested in such
researches. A subscription has been opened for this purpose, and
gentlemen can obtain the requisite information on this subject by
calling on the Corresponding Secretary of the New England Historical
and Genealogical Society.

       *       *       *       *       *

->We regret that the first two Nos. of the Register have made their
appearance so late in the Quarter for which they were issued, and that
the principal likenesses accompanying them have been so ordinary.
Circumstances beyond our control have led to it. Arrangements were not
made for the publication of the work until after the year commenced,
when not a word was written, and not a likeness engraved. In future we
intend that the Nos. shall be issued punctually, and good likenesses
accompany them. For our next No. we have procured an excellent likeness
of Governor Endecott, engraved expressly for the work, which will
accompany a Memoir of the Governor.

       *       *       *       *       *

->The Register will be issued Quarterly, each No. containing at least
ninety-six pages, octavo, upon good paper, and with fair type; making
annually a volume of about four hundred pages; the Nos. to be issued in
January, April, July, and October.

The price to Subscribers will be TWO DOLLARS a-year, payable on
issuing the first No. Any person obtaining subscriptions and becoming
responsible, for six copies of the work, shall be entitled to the
seventh copy gratis.

Subscription Papers to be returned to the address of SAMUEL G. DRAKE,

or which respect the editorial department, should be addressed to the
Editor, at Boston.

All orders for the Register, and all communications respecting the
pecuniary concerns of it, should be directed to Samuel G. Drake, 56

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
