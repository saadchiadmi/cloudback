YE BOOK OF COPPERHEADS


"_ Continue this united League."--Richard the Third, III. 1_.


`|There once was a Copperhead snake tried to Bite Uncle Sam by mistake;

```But the Seven League Boot on old Uncle Sam's foot

````Soon crushed this pestiferous snake.

[Illustration: 0010]

|A soldier came back from the war, with many an honorable scar;

```But the Copperheads cried, "Served you right if you'd died

````In this curst _Abolitionist_ war!"

[Illustration: 0011]

|The old Tory dragon is dead, but she left us some eggs in her stead;

``Two were smashed in the yolk, but the third hatched and broke,

```And out came a vile Copperhead.

[Illustration: 0012]

|There was once a young giant asleep, and round him two serpents did creep;

```But he stopped their vile breath, and squeezed them to death,

````This giant aroused from his sleep.


[Illustration: 0013]

|There once was a Copperhead vile, who attempted to damage a

```So he tried it in truth, but soon broke every tooth

````On that rusty and crusty Old File.

[Illustration: 0014]

"_Nor doth this Wood lack Worlds."--Midsummer Night's Dream, II. 2._

|There was an old Snake in New York said for peace all the people should work;

``"But if war _must_ come, let us fight here _at home!!_"

```Quoth sanguiloquent Ben of New York.

[Illustration: 0015]

_"One of those who worship dirty gods."--Cymbeline, III. 8._

|There once was a chap named Vallandigham, whom the Copperheads chose for commanding 'em;

```But a trip to the South soon silenced his mouth,

````And the world as a _Tory_ is branding him.

[Illustration: 0016]

|With War Democrats Seymour's for war; with Peace cowards for peace he'll hurrah;

```Let him get in the way of the mower some day,

````And He'll find there's no quibbling with war.

[Illustration: 0017]

|The Copperhead lotterie hath a curious policie;

``For a man of low rank can draw naught save a blank,

````Unless an accomplice he be.

[Illustration: 0018]

|There once was a twistified Reed who took for his pattern Snake-Weed;

```Till the Copperheads all, great, middling, and small

````Seemed _straight_ by the side of this Reed.

[Illustration: 0019]

|There's a character very well known, Who bubbles for ages has blown;

```But the best he has made since at _bubbling_ he played,

````From a Copperhead pipe have been thrown.

[Illustration: 0020]

````_"And what Stock he springs of!!"--Coriolan, II. 3._

|Copper stocks are uncertain to buy, though this Copperhead's stock's very high;

```But we still might improve this stock of his love,

````By adding the _right_ sort of tie.

[Illustration: 0021]

|There was an old War Horse, a clerical, who thought our Republic chimerical;

```"For the Union," he said, "he never had prayed,"

````This mordacious old War Horse cholerical.

[Illustration: 0022]

```_" There is no goodness in the worm,"--Antony and Cleopatra, V. 2._

|The abominable Copperhead worms! With their wriggles, and twists, and their squirms!

```But the gardener, they say, will soon find out a way

````To kill the vile Copperhead worms.

[Illustration: 0023]

```_"There are many complaints, Davy, about that."--King Henry IV., V. 1._

|There was a Stern Statesman astute, who so often went in to _recruit_,

```That a Rattlesnake fat revolved in his hat,

````While a Copperhead squirmed in his boot.

[Illustration: 0024]

```_"So much dishonor my fair stars."--King Richard 111., IV. 1._

|The traitor our Common Cents mars, And on Liberty plainly he wars,

```Taking Freedom away from the Union, I say,

````When he cuts out her head from the stars.

[Illustration: 0025]

_"And so the lion vanished."--Midsummer Night's Dream, V. 1._

|While it did us great harm, Abolition was the height of the Lion's ambition;

```Now with Copperhead _tale_ he stings himself pale.

````And furaciously scorns Abolition.

[Illustration: 0026]

```_"Will this Wood take fire?"--Merry Wives of Windsor, V. 5._

|Union, a fagot we take; But 'twould be a tremendous mistake,

```To use rotten old Wood which never was good,

````And then bind it up with a Snake.

[Illustration: 0027]

|There once was a Patriot whose rigor reached such a remarkable figure,

```That he'd rather go down in the water and drown

````Than be saved by the help of a nigger.

[Illustration: 0028]

|There once were some rascals near Reading thought fighting was easy as wedding;

```But being well kicked, and most terribly licked,

````They mournfully mizzled from Reading.

[Illustration: 0029]

_"O wicked Wall!"--Midsummer Night's Dream, V. 1._

|There once was an old _party_-Wall, quite _cracked_ and just ready to fall;

```The Copperheads came and completed its shame

````By sticking their Bills on this Wall.

[Illustration: 0030]

|There once was a bottle of Porter, which the Copperheads thought was all water;

```But when the cork popped, the Copperheads dropped,

````And were stunned by the _vim_ of the Porter!

[Illustration: 0031]

|There once was a Snake who said "Hey! There's an Eagle I'll take for my prey!"

```But the bird with his bill did the Copperhead kill,

````And bore him in triumph away.

[Illustration: 0032]

```_"Exit shall be strangling a snake."--Love's Labor's Lost, V. 1._

|The Copperhead traitors all, our army "base hirelings" call

```But some fine summer day The "boys," just for play,

````Will settle the Copperheads all.

Amen!




GOTHAM-MITES.


|I like such Brooks," said Falstaff once;

``Had he meant _ours_ he'd been a dunce;

`The devil, whom all things evil please,

``Could never stand such Bruoks as these.=



`In the Tyrol on mountain high

``"The Devil's Marble" you may spy;

`And if in the World you long remain,

``You'll probably meet the same again.=



`Och, Johnny, my gun--let the truth be aid,

``What the divil made _ye_ turn Copperhid?

`Sure it was hivvy what ye bore,

``Wid the brass in your face yees had before.=



`There's a song how Old Nick took a journey,

``With a corporation attorney;

`But there is one _fouler_, whom even the old prowler

``Would fear as a friend on a journey.=



1.

`"The man who made that order," said

``Judge B. in court, "was a _meat-head_."

`Oh what a head that head would be,

``Just _meted_ Judge, to match with thee!=



2.

`"Just roll that nigger out of court!"

``The Judge exclaimed with solemn port;

`"I tell you very truly now,

``Nigs _at the bar_ I won't allow!"=



`At a Copperhead meeting the crier

``Paused an instant to hear his gun fire;

`The cannon was loaded, and when it exploded,

``Said he--"List to the voice of our sire!"=



``There was old party named M------,

``Who went from bad doctrines to worse.

`If at law he should see his name prefaced by _re,_

``It will show what he _should_ feel; this M------.=



```There was a small Cozening shyster;

``Said he, "Every case is an _eyester;_

`Give the parties the shells if you can, and nought else,

``Unless the Court tips you a hi-ster."=



``There's a man at the _Bar_ who, we know,

``Is in politics terribly _low_;

`For he keeps in the clubs the secessional cubs,

``Who in _propria persona_ can't go.=



``There's a very bad-minis-trator,

``A_ très petite pomme de tater_,

`Who tears feelings to rags, presenting of flags;

``This oily old adminis-_traitor_.=



``There's a wide-awake Copperhead cratur',

``Who is Eli by name and by natur';

`Displaying for one neither fashion _nor ton_,

``This un-national nativist traitor.=




CHECKER-BOARDERS AND KEYSTONERS


|There was an old person, J. B.,

``An old Public Func-tion-arie;  [agreed,

`When they swore, "We'll secede!" he just smiled, "I'm

``There was a smart lawyer named W------

``Who from Union men made quite a fortun';

`But his wealth he despised, with Secesh fraternized,

``This apo-state-olical W------.=



``There was a twistortulous Heed,

``Who hoped that Secesh might succeed;

`For he said, "It's my natur' to act like a traitor,

``Since it runs in the joints of a Heed."=



``There once was a Copperhead Diddle,

``Who played to the Heed second fiddle;

`When they said, "It is small!" it replied, not at all,

`Says he, "I ain't dead--as a live Copperhead

``I'm a squirmulous vermiform Wriggler."=



``There was an old servant called Peter,

``So moody in humor and feature

``Expelled this old saturnine Peter.=



``There was a sharp lawyer, one P-,

``Whose thoughts never got through his still lips;

```"What would you have, you curs,

`That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,

`The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,

`Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;

`Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,

`Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,

`Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is,

`To make him worthy whose offence subdues him,

`And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness

`Deserves your hate; and your affections are

`A sick man's appetite, who desires most that

`Which would increase his evil. He that depends

`Upon your favors swims with fins of lead,

`And hews down oaks with rushes."--_Coriolanus, I. 1._




"THOSE DEVOTED COPPERHEADS."


`"Our sympathies are all confined at home; yet it is just

`possible we may help those devoted Copperheads in the only

`way we know how--also, that they, on their side, are now

`about ripe to aid us in the only way we could accept their

`aid. If our troops should this summer appear within their

`borders anywhere between Cairo and Philadelphia, they would

`be hailed as friends by a population pretty well cured now of

`_Pluribus Unum_. Their cry would be, not Union, but deli-

`verance. _Wait then, and watch, and keep your lights burning,

`ye Knights of the Golden Circle!"--Richmond Enquirer_, 18th

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
