    Important Sale by Auction of the whole of the remaining Copies of that
    splendid National Work, known as "FINDEN'S ROYAL GALLERY OF BRITISH
    ART," the engraved Plates of which will be destroyed during the
    Progress of the Sale, and in the presence of the Purchasers.

SOUTHGATE & BARRETT have received instructions from MR. HOGARTH, of the
Haymarket, to Sell by Public Auction at their Fine Art and Book Auction
Rooms, 22. Fleet Street, London, on Wednesday Evening, June 7th, and
following Evenings,

THE WHOLE OF THE REMAINING COPIES

Of the very Celebrated Work, known as

FINDEN'S ROYAL GALLERY OF BRITISH ART,

Consisting of a limited number of Artists' and other choice proofs, and the
print impressions, which are all in an exceedingly fine state. The work
consists of 48 plates, the whole of which are engraved in line by the most
eminent men in that branch of art, and the pictures selected will at once
show that the great artists--Turner, Eastlake, Landseer, Stanfield,
Webster, Roberts, Wilkie, Maclise, Mulready, and more than thirty other
British Masters, are represented by the works which established and upheld
them in public favour, and by themes which appeal to universal sympathy and
happiest affections, or which delineate the peculiar glories of our
country, and commemorate its worthiest and most honourable achievements.

The attention of the public is also particularly directed to the fact that
ALL THE ENGRAVED PLATES from which the impressions now offered have been
taken, WILL BE DESTROYED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PURCHASERS, at the time of
Sale. By thus securing the market from being supplied with inferior
impressions at a future time, and at a cheaper rate, the value of the
existing stock will be increased, and it will become the interest of all
who wish to possess copies of these eminent works of art, at a reduced
price, to purchase them at this Sale, which will be THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY of
obtaining them.

Under these circumstances, therefore, SOUTHGATE & BARRETT presume to demand
for this Sale the attention of all lovers of art--the amateur, the artist,
and the public;--believing that no opportunity has ever offered so happily
calculated to promote taste and to extend knowledge, while ministering to
the purest and best enjoyments which the artist conveys to the hearts and
homes of all who covet intellectual pleasures.

Framed Copies of the work can be seen at MR. HOGARTH'S, 5. Haymarket;
MESSRS. LLOYD, BROTHERS, & CO., 22. Ludgate Hill; and at the AUCTIONEERS,
22. Fleet Street, by whom all Communications and Commissions will be
promptly and faithfully attended to.

*** Catalogues of the entire Sale will be forwarded on Receipt of 12
Postage Stamps.

DR. DE JONGH'S LIGHT BROWN COD LIVER OIL. Prepared for medicinal use in the
Loffoden Isles, Norway, and put to the test of chemical analysis. The most
effectual remedy for Consumption, Bronchitis, Asthma, Gout, Chronic
Rheumatism, and all Scrofulous Diseases.

Approved of and recommended by BERZELIUS, LIEBIG, WOEHLER, JONATHAN
PEREIRA, FOUQUIER, and numerous other eminent medical men and scientific
chemists in Europe. Specially rewarded with medals by the Governments of
Belgium and the Netherlands. Has almost entirely superseded all other kinds
on the Continent, in consequence of its proved superior power and
efficacy--effecting a cure much more rapidly. Contains iodine, phosphate of
chalk, volatile acid, and the elements of the bile--in short, all its most
active and essential principles--in larger quantities than the pale oils
made in England and Newfoundland, deprived mainly of these by their mode of
preparation. A pamphlet by Dr. de Jongh, with detailed remarks upon its
superiority, directions for use, cases in which it has been prescribed with
the greatest success, and testimonials, forwarded gratis on application.

The subjoined testimonial of BARON LIEBIG, Professor of Chemistry at the
University of Giessen, is selected from innumerable others from medical and
scientific men of the highest distinction:

    "SIR,--I have the honour of addressing you my warmest thanks for your
    attention in forwarding me your work on the chemical composition and
    properties, as well as on the medicinal effects, of various kinds of
    Cod Liver Oil.

    "You have rendered an essential service to science by your researches,
    and your efforts to provide sufferers with this Medicine in its purest
    and most genuine state, must ensure you the gratitude of every one who
    stands in need of its use.

    "I have the honour of remaining, with expressions of the highest regard
    and esteem,

             "Yours sincerely

Notes.

ST. AUGUSTINE ON CLAIRVOYANCE.

Dr. Maitland, in his valuable _Illustrations of Mesmerism_, has not, I
think, noticed an important passage in St. Augustine's treatise, _De Genesi
ad litteram_, l. XII. c. 17. §§ 34. _seq._, in which, after saying that
demons _can read men's thoughts_, and know what is passing at a distance,
he proceeds to give a detailed account of two cases of _clairvoyance_. The
whole is written with his usual graphic power, and will well reward the
perusal. I must content myself with a brief outline of the facts.

1. A patient, suffering from a fever, was supposed to be possessed by an
unclean spirit. Twelve miles off lived a presbyter, with whom, in mesmerist
phraseology, he was _en rapport_. He would receive no food from any other
hands; with him, except when a fit was upon him, he was calm and
submissive. When the presbyter left his home the patient would indicate his
position at each stage of his journey, and mark his nearer and nearer
approach. "He is entering the farm--the house--he is at the door;" and his
visitor stood before him. Once he foretold the death of a neighbour, not as
though he were predicting a future event, but as if recollecting a past.
For when she was mentioned in his hearing, he exclaimed, "She is dead, I
saw her funeral; that way they carried out her corpse." In a few days she
fell sick and died, and was carried out along that very road which he had
named.

2. A boy was labouring under a painful disorder, which the physicians had
vainly endeavoured to relieve. In the exhaustion which followed on his
convulsive struggles, he would pass into a trance, keeping his eyes open,
but insensible to what was going on around him, and passively submitting to
pinches from the bystanders (_ad nullam se vellicationem movens_). After
awhile he awoke and told what he had seen. Generally an old man and a youth
appeared to him; at the beginning of Lent they promised him ease during the
forty days, and gave him _directions by which he might be relieved and
finally cured_. He followed their counsel, with the promised success.

Augustine's remarks (c. xviii. § 39.) on these and similar phenomena are
well worth reading. He begs the learned not to mock him as speaking
confidently, and the unlearned not to take what he says on trust, but hopes
that both will regard him simply as an inquirer. He compares these visions
to those in dreams. Some come true, and some false; some are clear, others
obscure. But men love to search into what is singular, neglecting what is
usual, though even more inexplicable; just as when a man hears a word whose
sound is new to him, he is curious to know its meaning; while he never
thinks of asking the meaning of words familiar to his ear, however little
he may really understand them. If any one then wishes for a satisfactory
account of these strange phenomena, let him first explain the phenomena of
dreams, or let him show how the images of material objects reach the mind
through the eyes.

EDWARD GIBBON, FATHER AND SON.

Gibbon mentions in his _Memoirs_ (edit. 1796, p. 18.), that in 1741 his
father and Mr. Delmé successfully contested Southampton against Mr. Henly,
subsequently Lord Chancellor, but that, after the dissolution in 1747, he
was unable or unwilling to maintain another contest, and "the life of the
senator expired in that dissolution." Not so the hopes of the senator, as
will appear from the following extract from a letter, dated "Beriton,
January 27, 1754:"

    "I received the favour of your letter according to the time you
    promised. As Lord M---- has promised his own votes, I find there is
    nothing to be done: strange behaviour, sure! But there seems to be such
    infatuation upon this poor country, that even a good Catholic shall
    join with a Dissenter to rivet on her chains. There are several of the
    Independents would have me stand it out, but I would not on any
    account, for I find it would make great dissensions, and even several
    of Lord M----'s fagots and tenants would vote against him; and another
    thing, it would lessen him in the opinion of a _great many people_ to
    have him making interest for the two _present worthy candidates_
    against me. I shall therefore, upon his account, give over all thoughts
    of standing; and I hope it may give me some little more credit and
    merit with him against another election, especially if you would _be so
    good as to improve it for me_."

The following is of far greater interest--full of character. How well it
illustrates the paragraph in the _Memoirs_ (pp. 82-3.):

    "My stay at Beriton was always voluntary ... I never handled a gun, I
    seldom mounted a horse; and my philosophic walks were soon terminated
    by a shady bench, where I was long detained by the sedentary amusement
    of reading or meditation."

    It appears however, by this letter, that on one occasion he trespassed
    on some neighbour's game preserves, and received a hint on the subject:

    Beriton, Nov. 16, 1758.

      SIR,

    As I am extremely well convinced of your politeness, and your readiness
    to grant your {512} neighbours any reasonable liberty with regard to
    country sports, so I should be very sorry if either myself or my
    servants had taken any improper ones.

    I am no sportsman, Sir, and was as much tempted this morning by the
    beauty of the day and the pleasure of the ride as by the hopes of any
    sport. I went out, and, neither acquainted with the bounds of the
    manors nor your request to the neighbouring gentlemen, could only
    follow my groom where he led me. I quitted your manor the instant I
    received your message, without having killed anything in it. I assure
    you that you shall never have again the same subject of complaint. With
    regard to the liberty you are so good as to grant me for other sports,
    I return you my most humble thanks, but shall not make much use of it,
    as there are still in my father's manor more game than would satisfy so
    moderate a sportsman as myself.

    My father would be extremely angry if his servants had destroyed any of
    your game; but they all assure him they have killed no one hare upon
    your liberties. As to pheasants, they have only killed one this season,
    and that in Inwood copse.

          I am,
              Sir,
      Your obedient humble servant,
                  E. GIBBON, Junior.

BOHN'S "ORDERICUS VITALIS."

In looking through the pages of _Ordericus Vitalis_, vol. ii. (Bohn's
edition), I have noticed some trifling inaccuracies, to one or more of
which you will perhaps suffer me to call the editor's attention through the
medium of "N. & Q.," in case he be not already aware of them.

At p. 70. King William is described as offering the bishopric of Mans to
"Samson, _Bishop_ of Bayeux, his chaplain." So in the index to _Histor.
Anglic. circa tempus Conquestûs, &c., a Francisco Maseres_, I find this
passage of Vitalis referred to under the title of "Sanson Baiocensis
_episcopus_."

But yet Odo was Bishop of Bayeux at this time; and notwithstanding what
Marbode _afterwards_ said of Bayeux, when he invited his old pupil to meet
him there, viz. "Sedes præsulibus sufficit illa tribus," yet Samson, even
then, was not Bishop of Bayeux, but of Worcester.

The original words of Vitalis are, "Sansoni _Baiocensi_," Samson being
(temp. Will. I.) Canon and Treasurer of Bayeux, as well as Baron of Dover,
and Canon of St. Martin's there, Dean of Wolverhampton, and chaplain to
William. He was a married man, and apparently at the time in question only
in deacon's orders. One of his sons, at a later period, became Bishop of
Bayeux, as did also a grandson, whose mother (according to Beziers) was
"Isabelle de Dovre, maîtresse de Robert Conte de Glocester, bâtard de Henri
I., Roi d'Angleterre." Upon which I would found a Query, viz., Was this
grandson of Samson, whose name was Richard, an _uterine_ or a _half_
brother of Roger, Bishop of Worcester? Both are described as sons of
Robert, Earl of Gloucester.

At p. 261. Alberede is described in the text of the translation to be a
daughter of "Hugh, Bishop of Evreux," whereas in the original she is said
to be "Hugonis Bajocensis episcopi filia."

In a note to this passage we are informed that Hugh, Bishop of Lisieux,
died at the Council of Rheims (Oct. 1049), and that he was eldest son of
Ralph, Count d'Ivri &c. On the contrary, we are told at p. 428, note 2,
that it was Odo's predecessor (_i. e._ Hugh d'Ivri) in the see of Bayeux,
who died at the Council of Rheims, Oct. 1049. Again, in a note at p. 118,
we learn that Hugh d'Eu, who succeeded Herbert as Bishop of Lisieux in
1050, or the year following the Council in question, did not vacate that
see until 1077.

Before I close this Note, I should be glad to inquire what grounds the
editor has for asserting (p. 32, n. 1.) that Thomas, Archbishop of York,
"was not a chaplain to the king" before his promotion. Thierry, _Histoire
de la Conquête, &c._ (Par. 1825, tome ii. p. 18.), says: "Thomas, l'un des
chapelains du roi, fut nommé archevêque d'York." And by Godwin (_De Præsul.
Angl._, tom. ii. p. 244.) we are told that Odo--

    "Eum (Thomam) Thesaurarium Baiocensem constituit, et postea _Regi
    fratri commendavit, ut illi esset a sacras_."

A CURIOUS EXPOSITION.

The following curious illustration, which I met with the other day in a
book where few would be likely to look for it, seems to me fairly to
deserve a place among the Notes of your interesting publication. It forms
the _moral_ exposition, by Cornelius à Lapide, of Ex. vii. 22.: "And the
magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments," &c.

    "See here," he says, "how the devil contends with God, the magicians
    with the prophets, and heretics with the orthodox, by imitating their
    words and deeds. In our days, as the English Martyrology testifies,
    Richard White (_Vitus_) disputed with a wicked English Calvinist, who
    was more mighty in drinking than in argument, concerning the keys of
    the Church, and when the heretic pertinaciously asserted that they were
    given to himself, White wittily and ingeniously replied: 'I believe
    that they have been given to you as they were to Peter, but with this
    distinction, that his were the keys of heaven, but yours of the
    beer-cellar; {513} for this the _rubicund promontory of your nose_
    indicates.' Thus do heretics turn water into blood. This is their
    miracle."

Richard White I presume to have been an ejected Fellow of New College,
Oxford, afterwards rector of the University of Douai, and a Count Palatine
of the empire, author of sundry antiquarian and theological works; but it
is surely strange that this piece of ribaldry, of which he had been guilty,
should be thought worthy of being recorded; and still more so, that it
should be thus applied by a grave and learned Jesuit commentator.

_Antiquarian Documents._--At a time when public records and state papers
are being thrown open by the Government in so liberal a spirit, might not
some plan be devised for admitting the public to the Church's antiquarian
documents also, treasured in the various chapter-houses, diocesan
registries, and cathedral libraries?

Might not catalogues of these be printed, as well as the more historically
valuable and curious of the papers themselves? And is there any sufficient
reason why the earlier portions of the parochial registers throughout the
country might not be published, say down to the commencement of the present
century, prior to which they appear to have no other value except for
literary purposes?

    "The death of a single prince in any part of Europe, remarkable either
    for wisdom or folly, renders political conjectures of future
    contingencies so extremely uncertain, that I seldom indulge myself in
    forming them; yet it seems to me probable, that Europe will soon be
    divided among three powers, France, Austria, and Russia; and in half a
    century between two, France and Russia; and that America will become
    the greatest naval power on the globe, and be replenished by migrations
    of oppressed and discontented people from every part of Europe."--See

from the two ladies being called each "Lady Newport," a case was sent to
Dublin for the opinion of the Ulster King of arms. It is said he himself
was puzzled; Sir Simon's lady was not "Lady Newport," for Sir John's lady
had a prior and higher claim; she was not "Lady Simon," for her husband was
not Lord Simon; but he ultimately decided that the lady was to be called
"Lady Sir Simon," and she was never afterwards known by any other title.

Queries.

SEPULCHRAL MONUMENTS.

As recumbent effigies are in vogue, there are some points connected
herewith worthy of discussion at the present time in your pages. The
ultra-admirers of the mediæval monuments will not allow the slightest
deviation from what they regard as the prescriptive model--a figure with
the head straight, and the hands raised in prayer. One of their arguments
is, that the ancient effigy is alive, while the modern modifications are in
a state of death, and consequently repulsive to the feelings of the
spectator. In my opinion, however, the vitality of the old ones is very
questionable. Let us reflect upon their probable origin. In former times
the bodies of ecclesiastics and other personages were laid in state,
exposed to public view, and even carried into the churches in that
condition: a custom still prevalent abroad. It is reasonable to conjecture
that the monuments intended to perpetuate this scene in stone, imitating
the form of the deceased, with the canopy and bier, and adorned with
armorial bearings and other appropriate devices. Images of wax were
frequently substituted for the corpse, some of which (among them Queen
Elizabeth's) are still preserved in Westminster Abbey; but the practice was
kept up even down to the time of the great Duke of Marlborough. It is
recorded in history, that during the progress of the body of our Henry V.
from France, a figure of the king, composed of boiled leather, was placed
upon the coffin. York Cathedral contains a beautiful example of a complete
monument of this description in the Early English style, which degenerated
by degrees into the four-post bed, with its affectionate couple, of the
Elizabethan period. It is obviously a fair deduction, from these
circumstances, that the sepulchral effigies are "hearsed in death."

From Mr. Ruskin's _Stones of Venice_, it appears that the figures on the
Venetian tombs of the Middle Ages are manifestly dead; and such, it may be
inferred, is the impression conveyed to his highly cultivated mind by the
contemplation of those in our own country.

    "In the most elaborate examples," says this observant writer, "the
    canopy is surmounted by a statue, generally small, representing the
    dead person in the full strength and pride of life, while the recumbent
    figure shows him as he lay in death. And at this point the perfect type
    of the Gothic tomb is reached."

Describing one at Verona, of the fourteenth century, he observes:

    "The principal aim of the monument is to direct the thoughts to his
    image as he lies in death, and to the expression of his hope of
    resurrection."

And towards the conclusion of his review of their development he writes:

    "This statue in the meantime has been gradually coming back to life
    through a curious series of transitions. The Vendramin monument is one
    of the last which shows, or pretends to show, the recumbent figure laid
    in death. A few years later this idea became disagreeable to polite
    minds; and lo! the figures which before had been laid at rest upon the
    tomb pillow, raised themselves on their elbows, and began to look
    around them. The soul of the sixteenth century dared not contemplate
    its body in death."

Flaxman, in his remarks on the monuments of Aylmer de Valence and Edmund
Crouchback in Westminster Abbey, admires

    "The solemn repose of the principal figure, representing the deceased
    in his last prayer for mercy to the throne of grace, the delicacy of
    thought in the group of angels bearing the soul, and the tender
    sentiment of concern variously expressed in the relations ranged in
    order round the basement."

As, however, a canopy on the former exhibits a living figure of the
departed on horseback, such as Mr. Ruskin notices in Italy, and as the
angels are said to bear the soul, the knight must certainly have breathed
his last. The raised hands are no refutation of the argument, since there
are grounds for the assertion that those of the dead bodies laid in state
were sometimes tied together to retain them in the suitable position. A few
exceptional instances, no doubt, occur of variations in the attitude
irreconcileable with death, and equally inconsistent with a reclining
posture. It must also be admitted that in brasses and incised slabs (which
may be regarded in many respects as parallel memorials), the eyes are
almost invariably unclosed; yet the fact, neither in this case nor in that
of the carved marble, does not by any means certify that the individuals
are alive.

Since then there is so much reason for the supposition that the generality
of our ancestors are sculptured in the sleep of death, the recumbent figure
of a Christian clasping the Bible, and slightly turning his head, just
passed away into another state of existence (not into purgatory, {515} but
into a happier world), cannot surely be now deemed unsuitable to a Gothic
church.

QUERIES ON SOUTH'S SERMONS.

I should be glad to know the authority for the following statement in
South's sermon, _Against long Extempore Prayers_, vol. i. p. 251., Tegg's
edition, 1843:

    "These two things are certain, and I do particularly recommend them to
    your observation: One, that this way of praying by the Spirit, as they
    call it, was begun, and first brought into use here in England, in
    Queen Elizabeth's days, by a Popish priest and Dominican friar, one
    Faithful Commin by name. Who, counterfeiting himself a Protestant, and
    a zealot of the highest form, set up this new spiritual way of praying,
    with a design to bring the people first to a contempt, and from thence
    to an utter hatred and disuse of our Common Prayer; which he still
    reviled as only a translation of the mass, thereby to distract men's
    minds, and to divide our Church. And this he did with such success,
    that we have lived to see the effects of his labours in the utter
    subversion of Church and State; which hellish negociation, when this
    malicious hypocrite came to Rome to give the Pope an account of, he
    received of him, as so notable a service well deserved, besides a
    thousand thanks, two thousand ducats for his pains."

Also, who was W. W., the author of "a virulent and insulting pamphlet,
entitled, _A Letter to a Member of Parliament_, printed in the year 1697,
and as like the author himself, W. W., as malice can make it," referred to
in a note by South at the end of his sermon on _The Recompence of the
Reward_, vol. ii. p. 152. Is this pamphlet still in existence?

_Norwich, Kirkpatrick Collection of MSS. for the History of._--Mr. Simon
Wilkin, in the preface to the _Repertorium_, contained in his fourth volume
of his valuable edition of the works of Sir Thomas Browne, p. 4., having
spoken of the large collections for the History of Norwich made by Mr. John
Kirkpatrick, who died in 1728, and gave the said collections by will to the
mayor, sheriffs, citizens, and commonalty of the city of Norwich, in order
that "some citizen hereafter, being a skilful antiquary, may, from the
same, have an opportunity of completing and publishing the said history,"
&c., goes on to say, "the MSS. referred to were some years ago in the
possession of the corporation, but we fear the original intention of the
donor has been lost sight of, and that these valuable MSS. are for ever
lost to the lover of local antiquities." This was printed in 1835. But the
subject ought not to be permitted to drop and rest there. Up to that date,
can it be ascertained that the papers remained in the keeping of the
Corporation? Are they still in their hands, though inaccessible? Can any
information be obtained as to the _when_ and the _how_ they passed out of
their possession? Or, above all, can any clue be found to their subsequent
history and present resting-place? It may be suggested to any patriotic
citizen and antiquary of the fair city of Norwich, that, inasmuch as the
Corporation, by the terms of the will, are only _trustees_ for the
property, the Court of Chancery might be moved to assist in the recovery
thereof.

many families emigrated to England, and received shelter and support at an
hospital then situate in Spital Fields. I should feel obliged for any

would be found the names of the emigrants, and also whether there is any
publication relating to them.

_The Irish at the Battle of Crecy._--I should feel obliged if any of your
readers could inform me where the authority is for the Irish at the battle
of Crecy having been the first to come to close fight with the French, and
doing, "after the manner of their own countrie," effective service with
their skenes or long knives.

    [There is the best authority for this assertion, even that of the

    to the number of 4000 men of armes, and 10,000 archers, besides
    _Irishmen_ and Welshmen that followed the host on foot." The French
    historian also informs us, that the skene or knife was the chief weapon

_King of the Isle of Wight._--I was not aware that the Isle of Wight, like
the Isle of Man, had once been a kingdom. It seems that Henry de Beauchamp,
Earl and Duke of Warwick, was crowned, _circa_ 1445, King of the Isle of
Wight. Perhaps some of your correspondents may be able to throw some light
on this matter.

E. H. A.

    [Henry Beauchamp, Duke of Warwick, son of Richard Earl of Warwick, was
    crowned King of the Isle of Wight by patent 24 Henry VI., King Henry in
    person assisting at the ceremonial, and placing the crown on his head.
    Leland (_Itiner._, vol. vi. p. 91.) says, "Henricus Comes de Warwike ab
    Henrico VI. cui carissimus erat, coronatus _in regem de Wighte_, et
    postea nominatus primus comes totius Angliæ." Leland takes this _ex
    Libello de Antiquitate Theoksibriensis Monasterii_, in the church of
    which house this Duke of Warwick was buried. But little notice has been
    taken of this singular event by our historians, and, except for some
    other collateral evidence, the authenticity of it might be doubted; but
    the representation of this duke with an imperial crown on his head and
    a sceptre before him, in an ancient window of the collegiate church at
    Warwick, leaves no doubt that such an event did take place. (See
    Worsley's _Hist. of the Isle of Wight_ for a plate copied from an
    accurate drawing of the king.) This honourable mark of the royal
    favour, however, conveyed no regal authority, the king having no power
    to transfer the sovereignty of any part of his dominions, as is
    observed by Lord Coke in his _Institutes_, where this transaction is
    discussed; and there is reason to conclude that, though titular king,
    he did not even possess the lordship of the island, no surrender
    appearing from Duke Humphrey, who was then living, and had a grant for
    the term of his life. Mr. Selden too, in his _Titles of Honour_, p.
    29., treating of the title of the King of Man, observes that "it was
    like that of King of the Isle of Wight, in the great Beauchamp, Duke of
    Warwick, who was crowned king under Henry VI." Henry Beauchamp was also
    crowned King of Guernsey and Jersey. He died soon after these honours
    had been conferred on him, June 11, 1445, when the regal title expired
    with him, and the lordship of the island, at the death of the Duke of
    Gloucester, reverted to the crown.]

    [The Rev. Nathaniel Ward was the author of this work. He was born at
    Haverhill in Essex, of which place his father was a clergyman; and
    after studying at Cambridge, became minister of Standon in Herts; but
    was cited before the bishop, Dec. 12, 1631, to answer for his
    nonconformity. Being forbidden to preach, he embarked for America in
    April, 1634, and settled as pastor of the church at Ipswich, or
    Aggawam. He returned to England in 1646, and on June 30, 1647, preached
    before the House of Commons, and the same year published _The Simple
    Cobler_. He was afterwards settled at Shenfield, near Brentwood, where
    he died in 1653, in his eighty-third year. Fuller, in his _Worthies_,
    co. Suffolk, speaking of him, says, that he, "following the counsel of
    the poet,

     'Ridentem dicere verum,
      Quis vetat?'

     'What doth forbid that one may smile,
      And also tell the truth the while?'

    hath in a jesting way, in some of his books, delivered much smart truth
    of the present times." Dr. Mather, in his _Magnalia_, remarks of him,
    that "he was the author of many composures full of wit and sense; among
    which that entitled _The Simple Cobler_ (which demonstrated him to be a
    subtil statesman) was most considered." This work passed through
    several editions in England in 1647. It was reprinted in Boston in
    1713. The best edition, containing the author's subsequent additions,

    _Bec_, a Saxon word for a river), where was the old Custom-house. The

    divided from that {518} of St. Augustine, houses and streets began to
    be built there; Marsh Street terminated with a chapel, dedicated to St.

    near it, dedicated to St. John, and belonging to St. Nicholas; the
    church of St. Stephen and its dependent parish, and the buildings
    between the Back and the quay, seem to have taken their rise at this

THE ADVICE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO JULIUS III.

(Vol. viii., p. 54.; Vol. ix. _passim_.)

Your correspondent NOVUS has very judiciously warned controversialists on
the use of a document as emanating from the papal court, which, to every
one who reads it through (if a shorter examination will not be
satisfactory), must carry evidence of its not being papal authority, but
intended as a satire on Rome. A writer in the _Christian Remembrancer_,
vol. xii., attaches undue importance to the signatures, in the absence of
which, he admits, "we should conclude that this was the production of some
enemy in disguise."

In a 4to. volume of Tracts now before me is a copy of the genuine
document--

    "Consilium delectorum cardinalium et aliorum prælatorum, de emendanda
    ecclesia. S. D. N. Papa Paulo III. ipso jubente conscriptum et
    exhibitum anno 1538;"

two copies of the supposititious

    "Consilium quorundam episcoporum Bononiæ congregatorum quod de ratione
    stabiliendæ Romanæ ecclesiæ Julio III. Pont. Max. datum est. Quo artes
    et astutiæ Romanensium et arcana imperii papalis non pauca propalantur.

and several other tracts, so rare that an enumeration of them, and a few
extracts, will perhaps be acceptable to many of the readers of "N. & Q."

This is the opening of the epilogus _Colloquii Spadani_, a copy of which
rare tract is in the extensive collection of the President of the Chetham
Society. The epilogue contains an unmeasured invective against these three
"vassal slaves of servile Rome."[1] Wright's panegyric on Stanley is thus
introduced and distorted:

    "Egregia facinora tua vidit Hibernia, experta est Hollandia, agnoscit
    Hispania, prædicat Gallia, fatetur Flandria, neque potest negare
    Anglia. Ergo cum bona frontis tuæ serenitate sustinebis, si elogii tui

Had I not already occupied so much space, I should have added an extract
from Angell's _Epistle in commendation of England and the Inhabitants

    which art the head of the world, indued with those two faire eies, the

Had your correspondent NOVUS, in his first communication, specified by name
the _Consilium Quorundam Episcoporum_ as the document whose fictitious
character he desired to notify, I should not have been betrayed into my
supererogatory vindication of the _Consilium Delectorum Cardinalium_; the
latter piece having lately been much before me, and its very extraordinary
frankness in acknowledging the existence of the gravest abuses, of which
the Reformers complained, giving it so much the air of satirical fiction.
The use of the other document, moreover, being chiefly in the hands of a
class of writers I am happy in not being able to boast a very extensive
acquaintance with, recent anti-papal controversialists, I certainly did
think that NOVUS had impugned the authenticity of the genuine _Consilium_.

R. G. is mistaken in supposing that I thought there were _nine Cardinals_
in the committee which drew up the genuine _Consilium_, as the full title
of this piece will show:--_Consilium novem Delectorum Cardinalium et
aliorum Prælatorum, de emendanda Ecclesia._

LORD ROSEHILL.

(Vol. ix., p. 422.)

Something more than a partiality for the novelist takes me now and then to
the scene of the antiquary--Aberbrothock, or Arbroath. On one occasion, in
company with a few friends, we made a day of it in a ramble along the
romantic eastern coast of that burgh, and the scene of the perilous
incident related of Sir Arthur Lekiss Wardour, when rescued from the
incoming tide by being drawn up the face of the precipitous cliff by the
doughty Mucklebacket, under the superintendence of Oldbuck and young Lovel.
The fresh breeze from the German Ocean, and the excitement of the occasion,
imparted a keen relish for the locality and its associations; and by the
time we reached the hostelry of Mrs. Walker, at Auchmithie, a no less sharp
appreciation of the _piscatorial spread_ we had the foresight to bespeak
the previous day. Ushered into Lucky Walker's best dining-room, our
attention was immediately drawn to an aristocratic emblazonment of arms
which occupied one entire side of the room, with a ribbon, artistically
disposed over the same, upon which was inscribed Lord Rosehill, who was, we
were informed, the eldest son of the Earl of Northesk (Carnegie), a great
proprietor in that neighbourhood, and the special patron of our hostess and
her establishment.

With respect to the particular Lord Rosehill, alluded to by your
correspondent W. D. R., I beg to offer him the following brief notice from
Douglas' _Peerage_, by Wood, Edin. 1813:

    "David L. Rosehill (son of Geo. 6th E. of Northesk) was born at Edin.,
    5th April, 1749; had an Ensign's commission in the 26th Reg. Foot in
    1765; quitted the army 1767, and went to America. He married in
    Maryland, in Aug. 1768, Miss Mary Cheer, and died without issue at
    Rouen, in Normandy, 19 Feb. 1788, æt. 39."

From a dear old lady, whom I always find a mine of Forfarshire anecdote of
the last century, I obtain some corroborative proof that the said David
{520} Lord Rosehill was the eccentric character we might infer from the
above, in the assurance that he was "a ne'er do weel, and ran away with the
tincklers (_i. e._ gypsies) in early life."

If I may farther travel out of the record, allow me here to recommend to
such of your readers as meditate the northern tour this summer, to diverge
a little from the beaten track, and visit the neighbourhood above alluded
to; your antiquarian friends, especially, will be delighted with that fine
old ruin, the Abbey of Aberbrothock, now that it is brushed up and fit to
receive visitors. The worthy Mr. Peter, in charge, has some curious relics
acquired at the last diggins, and possesses a fragment of a black-letter
Chronicle to satisfy the incredulous that in identifying the objects
exhibited, he has his warrant in Hector Boece. The man of progress, too,
will find in Fairport, or Arbroath, a hive of industry; but, I regret to
add, threatened with a check by this closing of the Baltic trade, which is,
if I may say so, both _woof_ and _warp_ in the prosperity of this and other
towns on the east coast of Scotland. And lastly, the lovers of ocean,
rocks, and caves, will be not less interested with the environs, and I
doubt not all would leave it exclaiming with Johnson, that if they had seen
no more of old Scotia than Aberbrothock, they would not have regretted
their journey.

MAJOR ANDRÉ.

(Vol. ix., p. 111.)

On the 13th of January, 1817, Mr. Chappell made a report unfavourable to
the petition of John Paulding (one of the citizens who captured Major
André), who prays for an increase of the pension allowed to him by the
government in consequence of that service. On the question to reverse this
report, an interesting debate followed.

We copy the following from the _National Intelligencer_, January 14, 1817:

    "What gave interest principally to the debate, was the disclosure by
    Mr. Tallmadge of Connecticut (an officer at the time, and commanding
    the advance guard when Major André was brought in) of his view of the
    merit of this transaction, with which history and the records of the
    country have made every man familiar. The value of the service he did
    not deny; but on the authority of the declaration of Major André (made
    while in the custody of Colonel Tallmadge), he gave it as his opinion
    that, if Major André could have given to these men the amount they
    demanded for his release, he never would have been hung as a spy, nor
    in captivity on that occasion. Mr. T.'s statement was minutely
    circumstantial, and given with expressions of his individual confidence
    in its correctness. Among other circumstances he stated, that when
    Major André's boots were taken off by them, it was to search for
    plunder, and not to detect treason. These persons, indeed, he said,
    were of that class of people who passed between both armies, as often
    in one camp as the other, and whom, he said, if he had met with them,
    he should probably as soon have apprehended as Major André, as he had
    always made it a rule to do with these suspicious persons. The
    conclusion to be drawn from the whole of Mr. Tallmadge's statement, of
    which this is a brief abstract, was, that these persons had brought in
    Major André only because they should probably get more for his
    apprehension than for his release."

The question on reversing the report was decided in the negative:--Ayes,
53; Noes, 80 or 90.

It is proper to say that the question was decided on the ground taken in
the report, viz. on the injustice of legislating on a single case of
pension, whilst there were many survivors of the Revolution whom the favour
of the government had not distinguished.

From _The Gleaner_, published at Wilkesbury, Pennsylvania (copied into the
_National Intelligencer_ of Washington, March 4, 1817):

    "The disclosure recently made by Colonel Tallmadge in the House of
    Representatives, relative to the capture of Major André, seems to have
    been received in every instance with the confidence to which it was
    certainly entitled. That gentleman related what he saw and knew; and
    those who are attempting to dispute him, relate only what they had been
    informed of. To those of our readers who may not have seen the report
    of Colonel Tallmadge's remarks, it may be proper to observe, that those
    three men who captured Major André, applied to Congress for an increase
    of pension settled on them by the government, and that when this
    application was under consideration, Colonel Tallmadge (a member for
    Connecticut) rose and stated, that having been the officer to whom the
    care of André was entrusted, he had heard André declare that those men
    robbed him, and upon his offer to reward them for taking him to the
    British lines, he believes they declined only from the impossibility of
    giving them sufficient security, &c., and that it was not patriotism
    but the hope of gain which induced them to deliver him to the
    Americans. To this declaration of Colonel Tallmadge, and in support of
    his opinion, we are happy to have it in our power to offer the
    following corroborating testimony.

    "There is now living in this town a gentleman who was an officer in the
    Massachusets line, and who was particularly conversant in all the
    circumstances of that transaction. It was this gentleman who, in
    company with Captain Hughes, composed the special guard of André's
    person, was with him during the last twenty-four hours of his life, and
    supported him to the place of execution. From him we have received the
    following particulars: it is needless to say we give them our implicit
    belief, since to those who are acquainted with the person to whom we
    allude, no other testimony is ever necessary than his simple
    declaration.

    "To this gentleman André himself related that he was passing down a
    hill, at the foot of which, under a tree, playing cards, were the three
    men who took him. {521} They were close by the road side, and he had
    approached very near them before either party discovered the other;
    upon seeing him they instantly rose and seized their rifles. They
    approached him and demanded who he was; he immediately answered that he
    was a British officer, supposing, from their being so near the British
    lines, that they belonged to that party. They then seized him, robbed
    him of the few guineas which he had with him, and the two watches which
    he then wore, one of gold and the other of silver. He offered to reward
    them if they would take him to New York; they hesitated, and in his
    (André's) opinion, the reason why they did not do so, was the
    impossibility on his part to secure to them the performance of the
    promise.

    "He informs also that it was an opinion too prevalent to admit of any
    doubt, that these men were of that description of persons called 'cow
    boys,' or those who, without being considered as belonging to either
    party, made it a business to pillage from both. He has frequently heard
    this opinion expressed at that time by several officers who were
    personally acquainted with all these men, and who could not have been
    mistaken in their general characters.

    "André frequently spoke of the kindness of the American officers, and
    particularly of the attention of Major Tallmadge; and on the way to the
    place of execution sent for that officer to come near him, that he
    might learn the manner in which he was to die."

Statement of Van Wart (from the _National Intelligencer_ of Feb. 25, 1817):

    "Isaac Van Wart, of the town of Mount Pleasant, in the county of
    Westchester, being duly sworn, doth depose and say, that he is one of
    the three persons who arrested Major André during the American
    revolutionary war, and conducted him to the American camp. That he,
    this deponent, together with David Williams and John Paulding, had
    secreted themselves at the side of the highway, for the purpose of
    detecting any person coming from, or having unlawful intercourse with,
    the enemy, being between the two armies; a service not uncommon in
    those times. That this deponent and his companions were armed with
    muskets, and upon seeing Major André approach the place where they were
    concealed, they rose and presented their muskets at him, and required
    him to stop, which he did. He then asked them whether they belonged to
    his party, and then they asked him which was his party? to which he
    replied the lower party. Upon which they, deeming a little stratagem
    under such circumstances not only justifiable but necessary, gave him
    to understand that they were of his party, upon which he joyfully
    declared himself to be a British officer, and told them that he had
    been out upon very particular business. Having ascertained thus much,
    this deponent and his companions undeceived him as to their characters,
    declaring themselves to be Americans, and that he must consider himself
    their prisoner. Upon this, with seeming unconcern, he said he had a
    pass from General Arnold, which he exhibited, and then insisted on
    their permitting him to proceed. But they told him that, as he had
    confessed himself to be a British officer, they deemed it to be their
    duty to convey him to the American camp; and then took him into a wood,
    a short distance from the highway, in order to guard against being
    surprised by parties of the enemy, who were frequently reconnoitering
    in that neighbourhood. That when they had him in the wood they
    proceeded to search him, for the purpose of ascertaining who and what
    he was, and found inside of his stockings and boots, next to his bare
    feet, papers which satisfied them he was a spy. Major André now showed
    them his gold watch, and remarked that it was evidence of his being a
    gentleman, and also promised to make them any reward they might name,
    if they would but permit him to proceed, which they refused. He then
    told them that if they doubted the fulfilment of his promise, they
    might conceal him in some secret place, and keep him there until they
    could send to New York and receive their reward. And this deponent
    expressly declares, that every offer made by Major André to them was
    promptly and resolutely refused. And, for himself, he solemnly declares
    that he had not, and he does most sincerely believe that Paulding and
    Williams had not, any intention of plundering their prisoner; nor did
    they confer with each other, or even hesitate whether they should
    accept his promise, but, on the contrary, they were, in the opinion of
    this deponent, governed, like himself, by a deep interest in the cause
    of the country, and a strong sense of duty. And this deponent further
    says that he never visited the British camp, nor does he believe or
    suspect that either Paulding or Williams ever did, except that Paulding
    was, once before André's capture, and once afterwards, made a prisoner
    by the British, as this deponent has been informed and believes. And
    this deponent, for himself, expressly denies that he ever held any
    unlawful traffic or any intercourse whatever with the enemy. And,
    appealing solemnly to that omniscient Being, at whose tribunal he must
    soon appear, he doth expressly declare that all accusations, charging
    him therewith, are utterly untrue.

    "We the subscribers, inhabitants of the county of Westchester, do
    certify that during the revolutionary war we were well acquainted with
    Isaac Van Wart, David Williams, and John Paulding, who arrested Major
    André; and that at no time during the revolutionary war was any
    suspicion ever entertained by their neighbours or acquaintances, that
    they, or either of them, held any undue intercourse with the enemy. On
    the contrary, they were universally esteemed, and taken to be ardent
    and faithful in the cause of the country. We further certify that the
    said Paulding and Williams are not now resident among us, but that
    Isaac Van Wart is a respectable freeholder of the town of Mount
    Pleasant, that we are all well acquainted with him, and we do not
    hesitate to declare our belief that there is not an individual in the
    county of Westchester, acquainted with Isaac Van Wart, who would
    hesitate to describe him as a man of a sober, moral, industrious, and
    religious life, as a man whose integrity is as unimpeachable as his
    veracity is undoubted. In {522} these respects no man in the county of
    Westchester is his superior.

THE TERMINATIONS "-BY" AND "-NESS."

The linguistic origin of these descriptive syllables, when found as
suffixes to the names of places, is a question of some interest to the
antiquary and ethnologist; and, as to the former of them, has, on that
account, fitly enough been made the subject of occasional discussion in the
pages of "N. & Q." The _-by_, as your pages evince (Vol. vii., p. 536.), is
implicitly relied upon by Mr. Worsaae and his disciples, in support of the
Danish theory of that eminent northern scholar; and that too, as it
appears, without any very minute regard to the etymology and meaning of the
former syllabic divisions of proper names so characterised. If only the
designation of a locality end with _-by_, evidence sufficient is given,
that it owes its paternity specially to the Danes alone, of all the
Scandinavian tribes who obtained a permanent footing on our shores. The
same is the case with respect to the termination _-ness_, and its
orthographic varieties. As with the Ashbys, Newbys, and Kirbys of our
several counties, so (_inter alia_) with the Hackness of Yorkshire, the
Longness of Man, the Bowness of Westmoreland, and the Foulness of Essex.
All have the Danish mark upon them; and all, therefore, possess a Danish
original, and bear witness of a Danish location.

With regard to the _-by_, I have already, in these pages, taken occasion to
suggest a doubt whether, in that particular instance, the Worsaaen theory
be not as fallacious as it is dogmatical. And, adopting the same method
with the _-ness_, I think it will be evident, on examination of the
following list of almost identical forms of the expression, that, as to
this point also, no argument can be founded upon it, one way or the other,
beyond the fact of its derivation from some of the Scandinavian tribes who,
in the fifth and succeeding centuries, established themselves on our
shores: if, indeed, I do not, even with this enlarged extension, assign to
the presence of the term in our topography a too restricted application.

I have a list now before me of 521 places with this suffix, distributed
over twenty-five counties. It does not pretend to be complete; but as it
offers a more extended view of the question than in Vol. ix., p. 136., I
subjoin the results:

                                                                 521
                                                                 ===

Our termination _-ness_, then, is the old northern or Icelandic _nes_, the
parent of the Dan. _næs_, and the Ang.-Sax. _nese_ and _næs_, signifying "a
neck of land, or promontory." From this _nes_ came, naturally enough, the
old northern _naos_ or _nös_, whence the Dan. _næse_, the Germ. _nase_; the
Ang.-Sax. _nase_, _næse_, _nose_; the Norman-Fr. _naz_, and Su.-Goth.
_naese_ (in Al. and Sansc. _nasa_, and in Gall. _nes_); the Latin _nasus_,
and Eng. _nose_, or _nase_ as it is spelt by Gower in his _Conf. Am._ b.
v., "Both at mouth and at _nase_." Closely akin to the same word, and
probably derived from an identical source, is the old northern _nef_,
whence were formed the Vulg.-Isl. _nebbi_, the Dan. _neb_, and the
Ang.-Sax. _nebbe_ and _neb_ (in Pers. _anef_; in C. Tscherh. _ep_, in Curd.
_defin_), the beak or bill, the _neb_ or _nib_ of a bird; and also used of
the prominent feature of the human face divine, to which the term is
applied by Shakspeare and Bacon, as it is occasionally at the present day
by the older inhabitants of the Yorkshire dales.

Thus have we the origin of our _nase_, _-nese_, _-ness_, _-nib_, _-nab_,
&c., which are found in the composition of many of our local proper names;
but, after looking over the foregoing paragraph, who can tell whether these
forms were transported to our shores in a Saxon, Jutish, Anglic, or Danish
bark?

NEWSPAPER FOLK LORE.

(Vol. vi., pp. 221. 338. 466.; Vol. ix., pp. 29. 84. 276)

Is it quite certain that "no animal can live in the alimentary canal but
the parasites which belong to that part of the animal economy?" Being
ignorant of the matter I give no opinion, but would bring before your
readers' notice the following seemingly well-authenticated instance. I
quote from _Insect Transformations_, 1830, p. 239., a work put forth by the
Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.

    "That insects are, in some rare cases, introduced into the human
    stomach, has been more than once proved, though the greater number of
    the accounts of such facts in medical books are too inaccurate to be
    trusted.[3] But one extraordinary case has been completely
    authenticated, both by medical men and competent naturalists, and is
    published in the _Dublin Transactions_, by Dr. Pickells of Cork.[4]
    Mary Riordan, aged twenty-eight, had been much affected by the death of
    her mother, and at one of her many visits to the grave seems to have
    partially lost her senses, having been found lying there on the morning
    of a winter's day, and having been exposed to heavy rain during the
    night. When she was about fifteen, two popular Catholic priests had
    died, and she was told by some old women that if she would drink daily,
    for a certain time, a quantity of water mixed with clay taken from
    their graves, she would be for ever secure from disease and sin.
    Following this absurd and disgusting prescription, she took from time
    to time large quantities of the draught; some time afterwards, being
    affected with a burning pain in the stomach (cardialgia), she began to
    eat large pieces of chalk, which she sometimes also mixed with water
    and drank.

    "Now, whether in any or in all these draughts she swallowed the eggs of
    insects, cannot be affirmed; but for several years she continued to
    throw up incredible numbers of grubs and maggots, chiefly of the
    churchyard beetle (_Blaps mortisaga_). 'Of the larvæ of the beetle,'
    says Dr. Pickells, 'I am sure I considerably underrate, when I say that
    not less than 700 have been thrown up from the stomach at different
    times since the commencement of my attendance. A great proportion were
    destroyed by herself to avoid publicity; many, too, escaped immediately
    by running into holes in the floor. Upwards of ninety were submitted to
    Dr. Thomson's examination; nearly all of which, including two of the
    specimens of the meal-worm (_Tenebrio molitor_), I saw myself thrown up
    at different times. The average size was about an inch and a half in
    length, and four lines and a half in girth. The larvæe of the dipterous
    insect, though voided only about seven or eight times, according to her
    account, came up almost literally in myriads. They were alive and
    moving.' Altogether, Dr. Pickells saw nearly 2,000 grubs of the beetle,
    and there were {524} many which he did not see. Mr. Clear, an
    intelligent entomologist of Cork, kept some of them alive for more than
    twelve months. Mr. S. Cooper cannot understand whence the continued
    supply of the grubs was provided, seeing that larvæ do not propagate,
    and that only one pupa and one perfect insect were voided[5]; but the
    simple fact, that most beetles live several years in the state of
    larvæ, sufficiently accounts for this. Their existing and thriving in
    the stomach, too, will appear the less wonderful from the fact that it
    is exceedingly difficult to kill this insect; for Mr. Henry Baker
    repeatedly plunged one into spirits of wine, so fatal to most insects,
    but it revived, even after being immersed a whole night, and afterwards
    lived three years.[6]

    "That there was no deception on the part of the woman, is proved by the
    fact that she was always anxious to conceal the circumstance; and that
    it was only by accident that the medical gentlemen, Drs. Pickells,
    Herrick, and Thomson, discovered it. Moreover, it does not appear that,
    though poor, she ever took advantage of it to extort money. It is
    interesting to learn that, by means of turpentine in large doses, she
    was at length cured."

VENTILATION.

(Vol. ix., p. 415.)

"Airs from heaven or blasts from hell."

The mistake which, it is very respectfully submitted, the professed
ventilationists fall into, and which may be considered the _fons et origo
malorum_, is the notion that foul air rises upwards, and that pure air
comes from below; which is just the reverse of the fact.

In any room containing animals or vegetables, the air undergoes a change by
respiration.

Leaving the vegetables to care for themselves, and considering the animals,
if such a title may be reverently given to members of the House and others
shut up in confined apartments for the benefit of their species, it is
obvious that the pure air of heaven must undergo a change by the
respiratory organs of the members, which change is absolutely necessary to
preserve their lives, and each such apartment is a manufactory for
converting pure into foul air. Its steam-power is seated in the lungs,
which, at each inspiration, take up the oxygen (the principle of life and
flame) of the air, and at each expiration give out the carbon of the blood,
conveyed by the veins from all parts of the body as refuse, and when purged
therefrom by oxygen inspired, convert the venous blood into arterial, and
bring life out of death.

What, then, becomes of the expired carbon? The professional ventilationists
say it _ascends_, and they provide mechanically, but not scientifically,
accordingly. On the contrary, it finally _descends_; and this is the reason
why our beds are always a few feet above the floor. If proof is needed, it
may be found by applying a candle to the door, slightly ajar, of a room
occupied by a few persons, when it will be found that the flame of the
candle will point, when held at the lower part of the door, outwards, and
at the upper part of the door inwards, showing how the currents of air
pass; and as every one knows carbon to be heavier than air, the lower
current is the one charged with carbon. The _Grotto del Cane_ derives its
name from the fact, that a dog passing the stream of carbon issuing from
the fissure in the rock, dies; whilst a man walking erect, with his mouth
above the stream of carbon, escapes. Our lime-kilns furnish a common
example of the fact of the density of carbon compared with atmospheric air.
Experiments in proof are constantly exhibited in chemical lectures.

The practical inference, _experto crede_, is that holes in the
skirting-boards should be made so as to draw off the foul air, whilst the
angelic visits of pure air should be sought from above. Bellows, such as
are used in diving-bells, with hot or cold air, might be necessary in an
extreme case--long debates in the Commons, for example,--which may require
extraordinary ventilation.

PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.

_History of Photographic Discovery._--Without entirely agreeing with the
opinion expressed to us a few days since, by an eminent scholar and most
original thinker, that photography was destined to change the face of the
whole world; we have little doubt it is destined to produce some striking
social effects. Its history is, therefore, an interesting one, and the
following extract from a paper "On some early Experiments in Photography,
being the substance of a Letter addressed to Robert Hunt, Esq., by the Rev.
J. B. Reade, M.A., F.R.S.," from the _Philosophical Magazine_ for May,
1854, seems, in that point of view, so important, that we have transferred
it to "N. & Q."

"I may assume that you are already aware, from my letter to Mr. Brayley of
March 9, 1839, and published in the _British Review_ for August, 1847, that
the principal agents I employed, before Mr. Talbot's processes were known,
were infusion of galls as an accelerator, and hyposulphite of soda as a
fixer.

"I have no doubt, though I have not a distinct recollection of the fact,
that I was led to use the infusion of galls from my knowledge of the early
experiments by Wedgwood. I was aware that he found _leather_ more sensitive
than _paper_; and it is highly probable that the tanning process, which
might cause the silver {525} solution to be more readily acted upon when
applied to the leather, suggested my application of the tanning solution to
paper.

"In your own history of the photographic process," says Mr. Reade,
addressing Mr. Hunt, "you say, 'the discovery of the extraordinary property
of the gallic acid in increasing the sensibility of the iodide of silver
was the most valuable of the numerous contributions which Mr. Talbot has
made to the photographic art.' It is nevertheless true, as stated by Sir
David Brewster, that 'the first public use of the infusion of nut-galls,
which is an _essential element_ in Mr. Talbot's patented process, is due to
Mr. Reade;' and in my letter to Mr. Brayley I attribute the sensitiveness
of my process to the formation of a gallate or tannate of silver. I need
scarcely say, that among various experiments I tried gallic and tannic acid
in their pure state, both separately and mixed; but the colour of the
pictures thus obtained with the solar microscope was at that time less
pleasing to my eye, than the rich warm tone which the same acids produced
when in their natural connexion with solutions of vegetable matter in the
gall-nut. This organic combination, however, was more effective with the
solar microscope than with the camera, though the lenses of my camera were
five inches in diameter. It is probable enough that the richer tone was due
to the greater energy of direct solar rays. In using the solar microscope,
I employed a combination of lenses which produced a convergence of the
luminous and photogenic rays, together with a dispersion of the calorific
rays, and the consequent absence of all sensible heat enabled me to use
Ross's cemented powers, and to make drawings of objects inclosed in Canada
balsam, and of living animalcules in single drops of water. The method I
employed was communicated to the Royal Society in December, 1836, and a
notice of it is contained in the 'Abstracts.'

"You inform me that some persons doubt whether I really obtain _gallate of
silver_ when using an infusion of gall-nuts, and that one of Mr. Talbot's
friends raises the question. It is sufficient to reply, that though gallic
acid is largely formed by a long exposure of an infusion of gall-nuts to
the atmosphere, as first proposed by Scheele, yet this acid does exist in
the gall-nut in its natural state, and in a sufficient quantity to form
gallate of silver as a photogenic agent; for M. Deyeux observes, that 'when
heat is very slowly applied to powdered gall-nuts, gallic acid sublimes
from them, a part of which, when the process is conducted with great care,
appears in the form of small white crystals.' M. Fiedler also obtained
gallic acid by mixing together a solution of gall-nuts and pure alumina,
which latter combines with the tannin and leaves the gallic acid free in
the solution; and this solution is found, on experiment, to produce very
admirable pictures. But what is more to the point, Mr. Brayley, in
explaining my process in his lectures, showed experimentally how gallate of
silver was formed, and confirmed my view of the sensitiveness of the
preparation. It is therefore certain that the use of gallate of silver as a
photogenic agent had been made public in two lectures by Mr. Brayley at
least two years before Mr. Talbot's patent was sealed.

"I employed hyposulphite of soda as a fixer. Mr. Hodgson, an able practical
chemist at Apothecaries' Hall, assisted me in the preparation of this salt,
which at that time was probably not be found, as an article of sale, in any
chemist's shop in London. Sir John Herschel had previously announced the
peculiar action of this preparation of soda on salts of silver, but I
believe that I was the first to use it in the processes of photography. I
also used iodide of potassium, as appears from my letter, as a fixer, and I
employed it as well to form iodide of lead on glazed cards as an
accelerator. Iodide of lead has of itself, as I form it, considerable
photographic properties, and receives very fair impressions of plants,
lace, and drawings when placed upon it, but with the addition of nitrate of
silver and the infusion of galls the operation is perfect and
instantaneous. Pictures thus taken were exhibited at the Royal Society
before Mr. Talbot proposed his iodized paper. The microscopic photographs
exhibited at Lord Northampton's in 1839 remained in his lordship's
possession. I subsequently made drawings of sections of teeth; and one of
them, a longitudinal section of a tooth of the _Lamna_, was copied on zinc
by Mr. Lens Aldous for Owen's 'Odontography.' I may say this much as to my
own approximation to an art, which has deservedly and by universal consent
obtained the name of Talbotype."

_Photographic Cautions._--Diffused light being one of the most common
causes of photographic failures, I beg to call the attention of your
readers to the construction of their cameras. Working with a friend, and
taking the same localities, using the same paper and chemicals, his
pictures have proved comparative failures, a general browning pervading the
whole, evidently the effect of light. Every inspection failed to discover
it, until the mode was adopted of putting one of the paper-holders in its
position as for taking a picture, then removing the lens, and, with the aid
of the focussing-bag, looking through the hole where the lens is applied,
when light became visible in many spaces, entirely accounting for these
failures. As many such cameras are now becoming made upon the same sliding
construction, every one should test his apparatus before he commences, for
such a one is entirely useless. Lately also the glass corners for collodion
plate-holders in the dark slides, have been by some makers replaced by a
sort of silver _looking_ wire, but possessing little of that metal. The
most minute portion of the copper in this wire coming in contact with the
excited collodion, produces a decomposition sufficient to spoil any
picture. These may appear trivial things to "make a note of," but as they
have caused much vexation to one who has had some photographic experience,
they may still more perplex a novice; and as you have done so much towards
making the science plain, I hope you will give them space in your
forthcoming Number.

LUX IN CAMERA.

_A Query respecting Collodion._--I have been making some collodion by Mr.
Tery's process, and have iodized it with a very sensitive medium. The
collodion is very clear and properly diluted. The ether I used had a very
powerful smell of sulphur, and was likewise very strong and volatile. I
diluted it with an equal {526} volume of alcohol. The ether was then still
very strong. The cotton dissolved freely. On mixing the iodizing medium,
the colour of the collodion turns immediately to nearly a port-wine colour,
but still remains very clear. I obtain a very good film of iodide of silver
from the bath, but cannot produce a picture under five or seven minutes,
whereas with the same lens, and the same iodizing medium, viz.

  Alcohol                    8 drms.
  Iodide of potassium        8 grs.
  Iodide of ammonium         4 grs.
  Iodide of silver         ½ gr.

I have obtained beautiful pictures in less than one second with collodion
prepared by the same (Archer's) process. As I have made a quantity of it,
and am unwilling it should be wasted, I have taken the liberty of asking
your opinion on the subject. Do you think the collodion is too new, or the
ether not good? On pouring the developing solution on the plate
(protosulphate of iron), the plate has the appearance of having ink poured
on it; but this appearance is removed on the application of the
hyposulphite of soda, and the plate remains as clear as when it was taken
from the nitrate of silver bath.

_The Céroléine Process._--Have any of your photographic correspondents made
such experiments on the céroléine process as to enable them to communicate
the results to "N. & Q."?

Is Mr. Crooke's process for preserving the sensitiveness of collodion
applicable to all collodions? If not, what collodion is best suited for it?

SILEX.

_Mr. Fox Talbot's Patents._---The injunction moved for by Mr. Fox Talbot,
as reported in _The Times_ of Saturday last, reminds us of a Query which we
have been sometimes asked, and which may just now be brought forward with
advantage, namely: If Mr. Talbot's patents extend to the collodion process,
how comes it that the earliest practisers of the collodion art had to make
their own researches? We know one skilful photographer whose experiments
were so extensive before he made any tolerable pictures, that his spoiled
glass and cuttings were more than a man could lift.

_The Olympic Plain_ (Vol. ix., p. 270.).--I have just seen, in examining
the contents of a German periodical, that in May, 1853, a proposal was
submitted to the public by Professor Ross, of the University of Halle, for
setting on foot a subscription to defray the expense of making excavations
in Olympia, thus anticipating, by nearly a year, a recent suggestion to the
same effect in "N. & Q." Professor Ross expatiates at considerable length
(see _Jahrbücher für Philologie und Pädagogik_, vol. lxviii. p. 203.) on
the advantages to be derived, as regards the arts, the literature, and the
history of Greece, from the exploration of so celebrated a spot; but,
notwithstanding all his arguments and eloquence, the amount of the
subscriptions, after the lapse of nine months, only amounted, in February,
1854, to about 38l. As this sum was so utterly inadequate for the object
intended, it was resolved to devote it to excavations in Mykenæ. Professor
Ross takes occasion to pay a high tribute of praise to Lord Aberdeen, for
the service rendered by his Lordship in discovering the treasury at Mykenæ.
The facilities at Olympia for carrying on excavations are stated by
Professor Ross to be very great. It is but a few miles distant from the
sea, on the banks of a navigable river, and opposite to the very populous
island of Zante; so that workmen, and means, and helps of all kinds can
easily be procured. It was intended to give the superintendence of the
excavations to Professor Alexander Rizo Rangabe, of the University of
Athens, who was to be supplied with an adequate staff of artists, &c.
Whatever discoveries might be made, were to become the property of the
Greek nation. Travellers were to be permitted to visit the excavations
during their progress, and to see all that was going on; and it was thought
that a considerable number might be attracted to the spot, as the Austrian
steamers convey passengers weekly in three or four days from Trieste to the
western coast of the Morea.

publication of the _Cyclopædia Bibliographica_ was undertaken. The work has
met your approval, and I have the pleasure of announcing that the volume
will be completed on June 1. I think it will meet the desire of your

"_One New Year's Day_" (Vol. ix., p. 467.).--The lines quoted by MR.
SKYRING are the opening lines of an old ballad, entitled "Richard of
Taunton Dean, or Dumble Dum Deary." It may be found in _Ancient Poems,
Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England_, edited (for the Percy
Society) by J. H. Dixon, Esq., who says:

    "This song is very popular with the country people in every part of
    England, but more particularly so with the inhabitants of Somerset,
    Devon, and Cornwall. There are many different versions."

In the notes to his volume, Mr. Dixon mentions two Irish versions of this
ballad, communicated to him by T. C. Croker, Esq., one of which, entitled
"Last New Year's Day," is almost _verbatim_ with {527} the English ballad.
The other version (which is given by Mr. D.) is entitled "Dicky of
Ballyman."

amusing instance, which occurred many years ago. A gentleman, a friend of
mine, who resided in an establishment where young ladies were educated, was
met one day by an honest farmer; who, after inquiring kindly for his own
health, said with equal good nature and simplicity, "I hope, Zur, the
ladies be all _pure_."

Query of the origin of the celebration of Chapel Sunday in the Lake
district, I would venture a surmise which some Cumbrian antiquary will
perhaps correct, if wrong. I take it to be the day in honour of the patron
saint of the chapel: and now, when such festivals are little observed, it
has been changed to the nearest Sunday. In this thinly populated district,
and where, from its mountainous and rugged character, travelling before the
formation of the present good roads was neither agreeable nor (probably)
safe, "at chapel" was the only time many of the inhabitants saw each other.
Meeting, therefore, on so auspicious a day as that of the patron saint,
might in "merrie time" of old induce a little festivity.

answer the purpose required by him. It is used by medical men as a dressing
for abrasion in the skin of bed-ridden persons, and is applied with a
camel's-hair brush. It hardens on being applied, and produces an artificial
skin, which saves the patient from farther suffering in the place to which
it has been applied.

EXPERTO CREDE.

Naphtha will render gutta percha soluble; and if needed to be used as a
varnish, it is only necessary to make a solution in a closed vessel, and
apply it with a brush. The naphtha will evaporate and leave a thin coating
of firmly-adhering gutta percha behind.

_Impe_ (Vol. viii., pp. 443. 623.).--This epithet has been much discussed,

In the Beauchamp Chapel at St. Mary's Warwick is the altar-tomb and effigy
of the infant son of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, with a long
inscription, which begins:

    "Heere resteth the body of the noble impe Robert of Dudley, Baronet of
    Denbigh, sonne of Robert, Erle of Leycester, nephew and heire unto
    Ambrose, Erle of Warwike."

In a letter from Edinburgh, dated 5th November, 1578, John Aleyn to the
Bishop of Carlisle, writes of "the goodly young Imp their King," who was
afterwards our James I.; and the Earl of Shrewsbury in 1585 writes of "my
wife and her imps," the lady being his energetic Countess Elizabeth

[Footnote 7: [Our correspondent [Sigma]. begs us to acknowledge the favour

He is informed it is to be found in the Transactions of the University of

_Jacobite Garters_ (Vol. viii., p. 586.).--I have lately seen a
watch-ribbon, or perhaps garter, with a Jacobite inscription in white
letters somewhat like that described by E. L. J., but only about half the
length. The middle stripe was red between two blue ones, and yellow edges;
there was no attempt at a plaid. The owner had no tradition about it, as
connected with any particular incident in Prince Charles' career.

"_The Three Pigeons_" (Vol. ix., p. 423.).--I think Washington Irving, in
his _Life of Goldsmith_, satisfactorily explains the origin of the song in
_She Stoops to Conquer_, which your correspondent G. TAYLOR supposes was
suggested by the inn at Brentford, mentioned by DR. RIMBAULT. The American
biographer says that Goldsmith and his companion Bryanton

    "Got up a country club at the inn at Ballymahon, of which Goldsmith
    soon became the oracle and prime wit; astonishing his unlettered
    associates by his learning, and being considered capital at a song and
    story. From the rustic conviviality of the inn at Ballymahon, and the
    company which used to assemble there, it is surmised that he took some
    hints in afterlife for his picturing of Tony Lumpkin and his
    associates, 'Dick Muggins the exciseman, Jack Slang the horse doctor,
    Little Aminadab that grinds the music-box, and Tom Twist that spins the
    pewter-platter.' Nay, it is thought that Tony's drinking-song at the
    'Three Jolly Pigeons' was but a revival of one of the convivial catches
    at Ballymahon."

And the author farther remarks, that

    "Though Goldsmith ultimately rose to associate with birds of a finer
    feather, his heart would still yearn in secret after the 'Three Jolly
    Pigeons.'"

If this be correct, as it most likely is, the song referred to, and the
scene it illustrates, were not suggested by the inn at Brentford.

The alehouse situate at Lishoy in Ireland, where Goldsmith's father was

author refers to Mr. John Forster's _Life of Goldsmith_, which I have not
at hand.

_Corporation Enactments_ (Vol. ix., p. 300.).--It is an easy, but generally
an unsafe thing to quote from quotations. ABHBA should have referred to
_The Dublin Penny Journal_, vol. i. p. 226., for his extracts from the Town
Books of the Corporation of Youghal, co. Cork; and, even then, might have
made farther reference to Crofton Croker's _Researches in the South of
Ireland_, p. 160., whence the paragraph (unacknowledged) was introduced
into _The Dublin Penny Journal_. Mr. Croker, moreover, fell into error with
respect to the dates of these curious enactments, which were long
antecedent to 1680 and 1703. I have seen them in the original (Book A), and
vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined:

    "1613-14. Thomas Geoffry made a freeman (being a barber), on condition
    that he should trim every freeman for sixpence per ann.

_The Passion of our Lord dramatised_ (Vol. ix., p. 373.).--A drama on the
_Passion of Christ_ (the first specimen of the kind that has descended to
our days) is attributed to St. Gregory of Nazianzum, but is more probably
the production of Gregory of Antioch (A.D. 572). It is described by most of
the ecclesiastical writers: Tillemont, Baillet, Baronius, Bellarmin, Dupin,
Vossius, Rivet, Labbæus, Ceillier, Fleury, &c.

In 1486, when _La Mistère de la Passion_, or the Passion of our Saviour,
was exhibited at Antwerp, the beholders were astonished by _five_ different
scaffolds, each having several stages rising perpendicularly: paradise was
the most elevated, and it had two stages. But even this display was
eclipsed by another exhibition of _The Passion_, where no fewer than _nine_
scaffolds were displayed to the wondering gaze of the people.

In 1556, according to Strype (_Life of Sir Thos. Pope_, Pref. p. vii.), the
_Passion of Christ_ was represented at the Grey Friers in London, on Corpus
Christi Day, before the Lord Mayor, the Privy Council, and many great
persons of the realm. Again, the same historian informs us (_Ecclesiastical
Memorials_, iii. c. xlix.) under the date 1557:

    "The _Passion of Christ_ was acted at the Grey Friers on the day that
    war was proclaimed against France, and in honour of that occasion."

{529}

It is generally considered that the last miracle play represented in
England was that of _Christ's Passion_, in the reign of James I., which
Prynne informs us was--

    "Performed at Elie House in Holborne, when Gondomar lay there, on Good
    Friday at night, at which there were thousands present."

Busby's idea, "that the manner of reciting and singing in the theatres
formed the original model of the Church service," is as absurd as it is
untenable.

EDWARD F. RIMBAULT.

It is said that Apollonarius of Laodicea (A.D. 362), and Gregory of
Nazianzum not much later, dramatised our Lord's Passion. Many, however,
regard the _Christus Patiens_, ascribed to Gregory, as spurious. The
Passion of our Lord was represented in the Coliseum at Rome as much as six
centuries ago. The subject was a favourite one in Italy. In France, "The
Fraternity of the Passion of our Saviour" received letters patent from
Charles VI. in 1402. Their object was to perform moralities or mysteries,
_i. e._ plays on sacred subjects. In 1486, the Chapter of the Church at
Lyons gave sixty livres to those who had played the mystery of the Passion
of our Lord Jesus Christ. In 1518, Francis I. confirmed by letters patent
the privileges of the Confrères de la Passion: one of their pieces,
reprinted in 1541, is entitled _Le Mystère de la Passion de N. S. J. C._
The same subject was common in Spain and Germany. In England the Coventry
mysteries, &c. partook of the same character. The Cotton MS. (Vespasian, b.
viii.) and the Chester Whitsun plays (Harleian MS. 2013.) would probably
afford information which I cannot now give. So late as 1640, Sandys wrote a
tragedy, on a plan furnished by Grotius, upon Christ's Passion. A little
research would give H. P. a number of similar facts.

If your correspondent wishes for authority for the fact of our blessed
Lord's Passion being dramatised, he will find an example in Gregor. Naz.,

paschôn], Rom. 1542.

Sahagun (Dec. 21, 1808) and Benevente (Dec. 29, 1808), previous to his
appointment, May 19, 1813, as Cornet, Royal Waggon Train, "from
serjeant-major, 7th Light Dragoons." I was in error in stating that he was
appointed "Lieutenant and Adjutant, Dec. 15, 1814, in the 10th Hussars, _in
which he had commenced his military career_." The 10th and 15th Hussars
were in action at Sahagun and Benevente, but Mr. Hardman never served in
the 10th Hussars until December 1814.

Query, Why is Sahagun not to be found on the appointments of the 10th
Hussars, as well as on those of the 15th Hussars, as both regiments were
engaged with the enemy on that occasion?

_Coleridge's Christabel_ (Vol. vii., pp. 206. 292.; Vol. viii., pp. 11.
111.; Vol. ix., p. 455.).--My Query relative to Christabel (Vol. vii., p.
292.) seems to have been lost sight of, and has not as yet received a
reply. Will you kindly permit me to renew it?

In the _European Magazine_ for April, 1815, there appeared a poem entitled
"Christobell: a Gothic tale. Written as a sequel to a beautiful legend of a
fair lady and her father, deceived by a witch in the guise of a noble
knight's daughter." It is dated "March, 1815," and signed "V.," and was
reprinted in _Fraser's Magazine_ for January, 1835. It commences thus:

 "Whence comes the wavering light which falls
  On Langdale's lonely Chapel-walls?
  The noble mother of Christobell
  Lies in that lone and drear chapelle."

Query, What is known of the history and authorship of this poem?

It will be observed from the dates, that the _sequel_ appeared in print
before Christabel was published by Coleridge.

J. M. B.

_Garrick's Funeral Epigram_ (Vol. vii., p. 619.).--Bishop Horne was, I
believe, the author of these verses; at least I have seen them in a volume
published by him, entitled (I think) _Miscellanies_: and I think they are
stated to be his in Jones' _Life of Horne_. But I have neither work at this
moment before me to refer to.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
