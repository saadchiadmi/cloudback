PREFACE.


Though the number of existing "Letter Writers" is many, the publishers
feel that there is yet a want which this little Manual, it is hoped,
will supply.

It has been compiled with great care from several sources, and
contains much original matter, for which experience assures them there
is a necessity.

  The Albany, June 10th.

  DEAR BROWNE,


  Will you dine with me at eight o'clock to-morrow? Some of our
  fellows are coming, and we mean to have a quiet game of whist in the
  course of the evening. Come if possible.

  Yours truly,


  ----


  _Accepting._

  Gower Street, June 18th.

  DEAR ----,


  I will come without fail, and win your money if I can.

  Yours truly,

  _Invitation to Family Dinner._

  Camden Town, March 4th.

  DEAR SMITH,


  Will you dine with us to-morrow? It is the old lady's birthday, and
  I can offer her no greater pleasure, I am sure, than your pleasant
  company. Do come if you can, there's a good fellow.

  Yours ever,


  ----


  _Accepting._

  Russell Square, March 4th.

  DEAR ----,


  I shall be delighted to accept your kind invitation for to-morrow,

  Medway Villas, June 8th.

  DEAR CAPTAIN MAURICE,


  Will you favour Mrs. Trevor and myself with your company at dinner
  on Monday next at 6 o'clock? We expect General Hill and his wife,
  and think you may like to make their acquaintance.

  With our united regards,

  Believe me,

  Yours truly,

  _Invitation to a Croquet Party._

  Havant, May 17th.

  DEAR HOWARD,


  The girls talk of having a croquet party on Thursday next. Will you
  join it? We shall be delighted to see you if you can come. Little
  Totty desires me to add, that you must play on her side, because
  then she will be sure to be one of the winners.

  Ever yours most truly,


  ----


  _Accepting._

  Havant, May 18th.

  DEAR ----,


  I shall be delighted to join your croquet party. Pray offer my best
  respects to Miss Totty, and tell her I will do all I can to prove
  myself her obedient servant.

  Believe me, ever yours truly,

  HOWARD.


  ----


  _Declining._

  Havant, May 18th.

  DEAR ----,


  I regret extremely that I cannot accept your invitation, and put
  myself at Miss Totty's disposal for a game of croquet; but,
  unluckily, I am obliged to go to town to-morrow, and shall not
  return till Monday week.

  Yours ever,


  ----


  _From a Gentleman, accepting an Invitation, though suffering from
  illness_ (_temporary_).

  Hampstead, May 4th.

  DEAR MRS. THURGOOD,


  I have been laid up with neuralgia for some days, and have not yet
  recovered from it. I will, however, accept your kind invitation for
  Saturday next, and hope to be able to come.

  With kind regards to yourself and sister,

  I remain,

  Yours very truly,

  WALTER BOSSORA.

  _A Gentleman regretting he cannot accept an Invitation._

  The Albany, February 1st, 187--

  MY DEAR MADAM,


  Thank you very much for thinking of me on Saturday. I should have
  liked to have joined your party immensely, but I go to Ventnor that
  afternoon, and am therefore unable to have the pleasure of accepting
  your very kind invitation.

  My mother and sisters have gone to Beaumaris; they left on
  Wednesday, and on the same day our friends the Boscawens returned to
  Ventnor. I hope to reach that truly lovely place on Saturday.
  Although a month has elapsed since the last year left us, I must
  send you and your sister all good old-fashioned New Year's wishes,
  hearty and sincere; will you both accept them? And with many thanks,
  repeated, for your kind note,

  Believe, me,

  Dear Mrs. B----,

  Your sincere friend,

  HENRY ROSS.

  _Invitation to a Gentleman to Row in a Boat._

  Chester, June 18th, 187--

  DEAR GEORGE,


  Will you join three friends and myself on Saturday next for a row up
  the river? You are a capital stroke, and we wish to get into the way
  of pulling a longer stroke than we have at present: little Jerry
  will steer us. Do not say No. We will finish the evening at the
  ----, where I have ordered supper.

  Yours sincerely,

  BEDFORD PRICE.


  ----


  _Accepting._

  Rock Terry, June 19th, 187--

  DEAR BEDFORD,


  I fancy you have formed too good an idea of my performance as a
  stroke oar; however, if you think I can be of any use to your crew,
  I will readily do my best. I shall sleep in Chester, so we need not
  hurry in returning from our practice.

  Yours sincerely,

  GEORGE SHEEPSHANKS.

  _Invitation to a Bachelor Party._

  Kidderminster, February, 187--

  DEAR FELLOWS,


  Yesterday I met Donovan and our four other old friends, who are here
  for a few days; they are coming to dine with me to-morrow at seven.
  I know it is some years since you met them; I hope you will make one
  of our party.

  Believe me,

  Yours sincerely,

  F. CUNNINGHAM.


  ----


  _Accepting the same._

  Hill House, Kidderminster, Feb. 187--

  DEAR CUNNINGHAM,


  It will afford me the very greatest pleasure to dine with you
  to-morrow at seven. It is many years since I met those you mention,
  but I have a vivid recollection of passing many pleasant hours in
  their society and companionship.

  Believe me,

  Yours sincerely,

  HARRY FELLOWS.

  _Invitation to a Gentleman to a Friendly Dinner._

  Dunland Place, Oct. 1st, 187--

  DEAR HINDMARSH,


  I heard by the merest accident, yesterday evening, that you were in
  town. Will you come and dine with us to-morrow? You know our time,
  but I may as well remind you that it is seven o'clock. I met J.
  F----, and our intimate friend from the north, yesterday. They will
  be here, and we shall have a little music in the evening, when I
  hope your tenor voice will be in its usual power and sweetness. All
  join in best regards.


  Yours very sincerely,


  ----


  _Postponing a Visit._


  Greenfield, October 10th.

  MY DEAR GEORGE,


  I regret extremely that we are obliged to ask you to postpone your
  visit till next month.

  We can not get the house at Brighton for which we were in treaty,
  till that time, and our present abode is so small that we are unable
  to offer a bedroom to a friend.

  I trust this delay will not inconvenience you. It is a great
  disappointment to us, as we longed equally for the sea and your
  company.

  My wife unites with me in kind remembrances.


  I am ever,

  Yours very truly,


  ----


  _Same._


  The Beeches, Sydenham, November 6th.

  MY DEAR TOM,


  I am sure you will be truly grieved to hear that the sudden and
  dangerous illness of my mother will oblige me to postpone our dinner
  party fixed for the 17th.

  I hope to give you better news shortly, and renew my invitation.


  Truly yours,


  ----


  _Invitation to be "Best Man" at a Wedding._


  Reading, May 6th.

  DEAR TOM,


  I intend to be "turned off" next Tuesday week! Will you attend on
  the mournful occasion as "best man?"

  _Seriously_, I am to be married to my charming little Ada on the
  ----, and I look for your presence at our bridal as the completion
  of my happiness, for then the man and woman I love best will unite
  in confirming my happiness.


  Always yours,


  ----


  _Same._


  Liphook, May 6th.

  DEAR JOHN,


  Julia has consented to our marriage on the 15th inst., and I
  scribble a line to remind you of your promise to be "best man" on
  the occasion. Marriage is supposed sometimes to separate bachelor
  friendships, but such will not be the case in my instance, my dear
  fellow. Julia has a great regard for you, and is too sensible and
  good to interfere between us with petty jealousies.

  I am awfully happy, Jack! Wish me joy, and

  Believe me

  Ever your true friend,


  ----


  _Accepting._

  The Albany, May 7th.

  DEAR ----,

  I shall be delighted to assist at the important event fixed for the
  ----, and beg to offer my best congratulations to Miss ---- and
  yourself on your approaching happiness.

  I intend to offer as my wedding gift a drawing-room clock. My object
  in naming this intention to you is that, if you are likely to
  receive a similar gift from any other friend, you will tell me so,
  and I will exchange it for something else, as duplicate gifts are a
  great bore.

  Ever, dear Hal,

  Your true old friend,

  JOHN.

  _Invitation to join a Party to the Derby_.

  Knightsbridge, May 22.

  DEAR NORRIS,

  Three of our fellows have agreed to go to the Derby together in a
  drag, and we shall be very glad if you will make a fourth. Jervis
  drives.

  Don't refuse, old fellow; we shall have a jolly day, and I shall
  enjoy it doubly if you go with us.

  Yours truly,


  ----


  _Same._

  Green Bank, May 23rd.

  DEAR REID,

  Will you accompany a party of us to-morrow to the Derby?

  Let me have an answer by bearer, and take care that it is in the
  affirmative.

  Yours ever,


  ----


  _Accepting_.

  London, May 23rd.

  DEAR GEORGE,

  I shall have much pleasure in accompanying you to the Derby. Let me
  know, please, the hour at which you start.

  I am, ever,

  Yours truly,

  J. REID.


  ----


  _Refusing_.

  London, May 23rd.

  DEAR BOB,

  It is awfully unlucky, but I am obliged to go to Chester on the
  Derby day, and _can't_ do as I desire. I wish you a pleasant trip.

  I am ever, yours truly,

  _Love-letter from a Gentleman to a Lady._

  The Temple, June 4th.

  DEAREST,

  Days have passed by now since we have had the pleasure of a few
  moments' conversation even; how these hours have dragged their slow
  pace along you and I alone can tell. It is only when we are left to
  the peaceful enjoyment of our own society that time flies. It may be
  that to-morrow at Mrs. E.'s we shall have a little time alone. We
  all dine there; she told me she should have a dance also, and that
  your mamma had promised her your sister and yourself should be of
  the party. May I ask for the first waltz? I send a few flowers, but
  I imagine you will only wear one, the rose in your hair; your sister
  is always pleased with a bouquet, so I shall not be very angry if
  you let her have them, only wear my rose.

  Your own

  EDWARD.

  MY DEAR FANNY,

  You are never out of my mind. If you only think of me half as much,
  I shall be satisfied. Sleeping or waking it is all the same, Fanny,
  you are my only thought. What have you done with your piece of the
  half-sovereign we cut in halves? I have bored a hole in mine, and
  wear it round my neck on a bit of blue ribbon, to show that your
  William is true blue. Do you wear yours the same, my dearest Fanny?
  When I come home we will splice the halves, and Fanny and her
  William will be one--will we not, darling girl? Our cruise will now
  soon be over; I only hope, Fanny, you have been as true to me as I
  have been to you; never have I ceased thinking of you. Bear in mind
  your faithful William, who loves you as fondly as ever.

  Your devoted lover,

  WILLIAM.

  _Gentleman's reply to the Lady, imagining he was indifferent to
  her._

  Gillingham, April 16th, 187-

  DEAREST LOVE,

  Such I must and will, with your permission, always call you. Your
  letter really caused me much uneasiness. But, Dr. B., who came in
  just as it arrived, strictly forbade me to excite myself in any way,
  and would not allow me to reply to it immediately, as he feared an
  immediate return of my old heart complaint. Who can have been so
  mischievous, so ungenerous, so determined to make two hearts
  miserable, as to invent this wicked story of my flirtation with Miss
  G.? You name Mrs. G. On inquiring of her this morning I find she
  heard it somewhere spoken of, she says, but cannot recall to her
  mind the person who mentioned it. Let me at once and for ever
  disabuse you of such a suspicion. My affection for you is unchanged
  and unchangeable; often and often I have by letter and verbally too,
  pledged myself that you alone, Katie dearest, were my only thought,
  my only joy. Banish all vain suspicions from your mind. Trust in me;
  I will never deceive you; my love is inviolably yours; for you I
  breathe, for you I live, without you I should die. Believe me,
  dearest, night and day you are uppermost in my thoughts, and a sad,
  sad day it would be for me if for one moment you withdrew that
  confidence in me that I have so long happily possessed. Believe no
  aspersions against one who loves you madly. The time, I trust, will
  soon arrive when I can call you mine alone, and no breath of
  suspicion shall ever fall upon my fidelity. Love me then, my
  dearest, as your own heart dictates; have no cares in future as to
  any attention even in the least degree being shown by me to any one,
  further than due civility, or what is required from the usages of
  society, exacts. To-morrow I will do myself the pleasure of calling,

  DEAR MISS ----,

  As no opportunity has presented itself of speaking to you lately
  alone, I venture to address you by letter, and I assure you my
  happiness greatly depends on the reply with which you may deign to
  favour me.

  I love you, dear Miss ----, very sincerely, and if you can return my
  affection and become my wife, I shall consider myself the most
  fortunate of men.

  The income which I can place at your disposal is not large, but in
  my family you will find the most tender and affectionate connexions.
  My mother (to whom alone I have confided my secret) is rejoiced at
  the hope of having you for a daughter. Do not, best beloved Miss
  Johnstone, disappoint her and myself! Should you not reject me--if I
  am ever so happy as to call you my wife--the tenderest and most
  affectionate devotion shall be yours, and the principal and only
  study of my future days shall be to render your life as happy as you
  deservedly merit it should be. Your reply is most impatiently
  awaited by one whose life is wrapped up in yours. My aunt has just
  called, and it appears that some years since she was very intimately
  acquainted with your father, to whom I have written, enclosing this
  note for you, and stating to him the purport of its contents.

  I remain,

  Dear Miss Johnstone,

  Yours very truly,

  HARRY CLINTON.

  DEAREST JULIA,

  I can scarcely compose myself to write, for this very morning, at
  mid-day parade, a telegram was received by our commanding officer
  directing the regiment to hold itself under orders for immediate
  foreign service; so that of course I shall be prevented seeing you
  before our departure, as all leave is stopped for officers as well
  as for the non-commissioned officers and men. Where our future
  destination may be no one can at present conjecture, but we think it
  may be Canada. How blighted now are our hopes! where all seemed
  bright and joyous, nothing is left but separation and blank despair.
  Julia, you love me; you are mine, are you not, dear Julia? Although
  separated for a time, we shall love each other faithfully; no doubts
  must arise, no feelings of suspicion or fear between us; but firm in
  the knowledge that we are devotedly attached to each other, and that
  nothing can change the ardent feelings we entertain, we must wait
  and hope. I trust in a few short years, my darling Julia, to call
  you mine. Your Ronald will be true to his promise and his love, and
  in faith that his Julia will bear up bravely, as a soldier's
  destined wife should do, he obeys his country's call in anguish but
  not in despair. Accept the little present I send you (forwarded by
  registered letter by this evening's post), and with most
  affectionate and enduring love,

  Believe me,

  My dearest Julia,

  Your ever devoted,

  MY DEAREST WIFE,

  I take the opportunity of the pilot's return to send you a hurried
  and last farewell. Oh, my dearest, what but duty could reconcile me
  to leaving you? What but the certainty that we are both protected by
  our Heavenly Father could support me through the weary days and
  nights which I am destined to spend far from you? Ah! the waves that
  are now washing the sides of our vessel will soon cease to beat upon
  that shore where my wife, where my friends are all thinking of me.

  Farewell my dearest wife; be assured I am in good health and
  tolerable spirits.

  Comfort yourself, my dearest! we shall all meet soon and happily
  again. I have not time to write to my mother, but pray tell her she
  is always in my thoughts. God bless you, dearest!--my heart is full

  DEAREST ISABELLA,

  This is the first time, my darling, we have ever experienced the
  bitterness and misery of separation, and the few days I have
  already been absent from you appear like years. What my state of
  mind will be at the expiration of another two or three weeks I will
  let your little affectionate heart conjecture. But I must not be
  selfish, my dearest Isa. You share my trial, but do not be
  down-hearted, the time will soon pass away. You must go out and
  visit the nice friends near you. Your dear kind mother also is
  within an easy walk, I am glad to think.

  Roger Hughes is going to stay with his family for some little while;
  I do not care much about him (you remember we met him at ----). He

  _From a Father to his Son beginning the World._

  Hampstead, May 6th, 187-

  MY DEAREST SON,

  Separated as you will shortly be from your childhood's home--for
  many years, perhaps--and not having your poor old father to consult
  and obtain advice from, when any difficulties may arise, you will
  naturally be inclined to appeal to those among your acquaintances
  whom you may consider from intimate association as entitled to the
  name of friends.

  Now this is a matter in which you must observe the very greatest
  caution and discrimination; a mistake made in selecting a friend and
  acting up to his advice, is a fatal one, and no one can for a moment
  form an idea of the consequences which may arise from it. In the
  first place, do not seek the friendship of the "fast young man"
  whose sole thought is to gratify himself in the enjoyment of this
  world's pleasures, without any regard to the misery or disgrace his
  conduct may be entailing on a happy, innocent family. Make friends
  of those who, by their actions, have raised themselves in the
  estimation of their superiors, and are regarded with eyes of jealous
  admiration by their equals. Remember the old proverb, "Tell who are
  your friends, and I will tell you what you are."

  I hope, dear boy, your own good sense will lead you to avoid bad
  companions. Should you ever (which I trust may never be the case) be
  tempted to do anything contrary to the laws of honour or of duty,
  question yourself thus: "Should I do this in my father's house?
  should I act thus in my mother's presence?" The answer will be the
  best talisman to keep you from falling in your combat with the
  world.

  We have great hopes in you, my dear son. Never omit to write to your
  dear mother and myself, when you possibly can; and with our best and
  fondest love,

  Believe me,

  Ever your affectionate father,

  DEAR FATHER,

  I am in such distress I scarcely know how to commence my letter.
  Without the least reason, without the least provocation, I left my
  master at the most busy season, just for a temporary, trifling
  amusement. He--the best of masters--for the moment was forgotten by
  me: self predominated. I ran away from my service, and here I find
  myself disgraced and miserable, and grieve to think how
  indescribably shocked you will be when Mr. Evans communicates with
  you relative to my absence. However, dear father, there is one
  consolation: I cannot be accused of dishonesty; so I hope my
  character is not irretrievably ruined. Will you see my master, and
  tell him how deeply I regret my fault, and entreat him to forgive
  me? It shall hereafter be my constant study to perform my duty in
  the most upright manner, and with the most assiduous attention. Let
  me hear also, dear father, in sending me Mr. Evans's reply, that you
  also forgive

  Your erring, but heartbroken son,

  MY DEAR SON,

  Words cannot express my grief at the receipt of your letter. How can
  you so soon have forgotten all the home lessons of duty you have
  learned? What society can you have mingled in to have caused you to
  be guilty of such folly? I have seen your master, and read him your
  letter; and he agrees with myself that from the manner you have
  acted in immediately informing me of your position, it is probable
  you may, in an untoward moment, have been induced to commit an act
  which you will never cease to regret. It is your first offence, and
  he bids me say he rejoices that you are sensible of your grievous
  error, and he will allow you to return, and never mention what has
  occurred to you. Never, dear son, forget yourself again, be grateful
  to your master, who is charity itself, and

  MY DEAR SAMUEL,

  I was much grieved to find after you had left us in the early part
  of the week, that the replies you gave me relative to your
  acquaintance with the L----s were utterly at variance with the
  truth. Little did I think you would ever deceive us, when such
  confidence has been always placed in you. Why did you try to
  deceive me by a falsehood?

  Let me entreat of you never again to deviate from the truth; should
  you do so you will soon obtain a character as an untrustworthy
  person, and no one will believe you, even when you speak the truth.
  Every one will shun you, as they will always suspect that you are
  trying to deceive them; even when you are acting rightly they will
  look upon you with suspicion.

  Have you forgotten that Truth is the point of honour in a gentleman,
  and that no one can tell a falsehood and retain the character of
  one?

  I cannot tell you the shame I felt when I discovered your untruth; I
  felt degraded by it.

  Strive to retrieve your character in the future, by perfect
  truthfulness and a high sense of what honour requires from you.

  Till I believe that you feel the enormity of your fault I cannot

  Upton, June 12th, 187-

  DEAR FREDERICK,

  Your letter of the 1st, informing me that you had determined to
  remain in your present profession, caused me great distress. If you
  wish to add some little portion of comfort to the last years of a
  father's life, which your headstrong passions have already greatly
  embittered, you will immediately relinquish it. Remember you are the
  only representative of our family. Why then persist in remaining in
  a profession wherein you are exposed to constant and imminent
  danger?

  I wish you to marry, and hope to see you settle down and discharge
  the duties of your position in society as a country gentleman; you
  have ample means at your disposal now, as the whole of your late
  uncle's property is yours. Concede a little to your father, whose
  only desire is to see his name honourably upheld, his family
  perpetuated, in the county in which we are now so much respected.
  Age is creeping on me, Frederick, I am widowed and alone. I trust
  this appeal will not be made in vain. You know my deep and lasting
  affection for you; do not wound it by a refusal. Awaiting with great
  anxiety your determination,

  _A Letter from a Father to a Son at School, on the necessity of
  attention to his Studies._

  Mudiford, January 28th, 187-

  MY DEAR BOY,

  Now you have returned to school it is my duty to point out to you
  how absolutely necessary it is for your future success that you
  should persevere in your studies, more especially if you wish to
  leave college (for which you are destined) with honour. Do not be
  carried away with the natural love of ease and pleasure, but
  accustom yourself at once to really hard work. If you cannot
  reconcile yourself to do so in your youth you will be unable to do
  so as you grow older, and you will become incapable of achieving
  anything great. Application may be difficult at first, but when once
  you have accustomed yourself to it you will find study pleasant,
  easy, and agreeable, and in years to come you will be well repaid
  for the toil and trouble you now undergo. What can be pleasanter
  than to find yourself at the head of your school, leaving all
  competitors behind? what more gratifying than to give pleasure to
  your father and mother, and to obtain the admiration and approval of
  your teachers? That, dear boy, will be your reward if you study
  constantly and patiently; but if you neglect the opportunities
  offered to you now, your future life will be nothing but
  disquietude, and you will grow up ignorant, and be despised. Pay
  attention to my advice, and work in the morning of your days. With
  your mother's best love and mine,

  Believe me,

  Your ever affectionate father,

  R. R.

  _Reply to a Letter from a young Man informing his Uncle he had
  contracted Debts._

  Soltney, March 4th, 187-

  MY DEAR NEPHEW,

  I was indeed deeply grieved on the receipt of your letter to find
  you had forgotten, or at least not acted up to the advice I gave
  you--to pay for everything you purchased at once, and not to go into
  debt on any account. I must put things before you now in a plain
  unvarnished manner, and give you my opinion, formed after many
  years' experience. The man who contracts debts which he is unable to
  pay, more especially for articles of useless luxury, is much more
  culpable than the poor creature who, distracted by all the miseries
  of his starving family at home, rushes into the first shop he sees
  and steals something to relieve their necessities.

  When men find themselves encumbered with debts which they are unable
  to pay, mean subterfuges are resorted to; applications for delay of
  payment are made--and granted, without any good result; the final
  crash comes at last: the patience and temper of the tradesmen become
  exhausted, they have recourse to their legal remedy, and
  wretchedness and beggary are the result.

  It may be that you have been endeavouring to keep pace with some
  young man of greater fortune than your own. Be not led away by such
  absurd vanity. The largest income will be and has been squandered,
  unknown as it were to its possessor, solely from the crime (and a
  great one too it is) of running into debt. I regret that I cannot
  assist you at present with the loan you request, and remain

  Your affectionate uncle,

  T. H. P.

  MY DEAR SON,

  Your last letter gave us pleasure not unmixed with pain: pleasure to
  learn that you were well, and held in esteem by your superiors, and
  on friendly terms with those of your own standing; and pain from the
  request which it contained. Your mother, like myself, feels grieved
  that you should ask for an additional allowance. You should consider
  that you have brothers and sisters for whom I have also to make a
  provision, and that if the allowance I now give you (which is
  considered large) be increased, it must deprive us all of some of
  our necessary comforts. You must reflect on this, dear boy, and then
  I am well assured that you will not urge your request. I will,
  however (for this once alone, understand me), make you a present of
  Thirty Pounds. Your own good sense, I am certain, will show you the
  necessity of retrenchment, so I shall not allude to the matter
  further. The presents you sent us each by last mail are much
  appreciated and treasured by us.

  We are going to move from this neighbourhood, as we find it too
  expensive; when next you write, therefore, address to Durnford
  Street.

  Your brother Fred is going to be married, but will live near us. His
  future wife is a daughter of Mr. Passmore, and at his death she will
  have about 2000_l_.; at present he will make her an allowance of
  80_l_. per annum.

  All your pets are well, and we guard them jealously for your sake.
  Trusting you will remain some time at Shopoo, as it agrees with you
  so well, and that we may constantly hear from you,

  Believe me, with our united kindest love,

  Natal, S. Africa, February 1st, 187--

  DEAR WILLIAM,


  You are well aware that when I sailed from England a few years ago,
  after paying my passage out I had but a very few pounds left; but I
  soon got good employment, and saved out of my wages all that I
  possibly could. I never was very fond of company, and have no
  expensive habits; so at the end of two years I found myself with
  30_l._ to my credit in the bank. When the report came here of
  diamonds being found up the country, I started off, bag and baggage,
  and on my arrival got an allotment, and went to work with a hearty
  good will. For many a weary day I toiled, giving myself little time
  for rest. At last I was rewarded: among the washings I found a
  diamond, a small one, yet what a treasure I thought it! On and on I
  toiled--some weeks with success, and others with none; however, my
  labours have been successful: I have been fortunate enough to find
  diamonds, which, when valued, have realized the handsome sum of
  £----.

  Tell my dearest mother that now she will never want. I am coming
  home, and shall invest for her sole use during her lifetime £----.

  Will you, dear William, look out for a good school for my little
  sister? She must be nine years of age now. Ask the clergyman's wife
  to recommend you one. I wish her to be educated as a lady, and she
  shall have the £---- at my mother's death. How I wish our poor
  father had lived to derive some comfort from my fortune! You shall
  have 100_l._ paid to your credit to provide the things Jane will
  require on going to school, and to pay for the first half-year's
  expenses there. I hope to be home in six months, when I will take a
  suitable house for our dear mother. If you will accept it from me, I
  make you a present of £----; with the remainder of my earnings I
  shall purchase a nice property, so that I may be certain my money
  will be secure, for were I to speculate I might lose all.

  With best love, and hoping shortly to see you happy and well,


  Believe me,

  Your affectionate brother,

  MY DEAR ----,


  Many thanks for your last letter, which arrived some three weeks
  ago. We never received the letter to which you allude, containing
  the photographs; and I am very sorry it went astray, for we should
  have liked so much to have them. I hope, if you have other copies,
  that you will kindly send them to us when you next write.

  We both desire to thank you for your kind and cordial reception of
  dear Richard. He wrote and told us how warmly you received him, and
  how pleased and gratified he was to see you. I trust he will come to
  see you again on his return from Devon, where he was when we last
  heard from him. We miss him terribly, and look forward anxiously to
  meeting him out here again next year, if, please God, we are all
  spared. James, his wife, and children are living down at
  Cheltenham. I wonder if there is any chance of your meeting? Sarah
  Maria is in Cornwall, but they took a house for a term of years near
  Watford, and will be back there, certainly before Christmas; she had
  no idea you were in London, and I must tell her of it when I next
  write to her. We are now in camp, marching about the district; of
  course I do my office as usual in tents every day--a happy, gipsy
  kind of life--and dearest Sophie and the little ones always enjoy
  it. Give my kindest love to Emma and Blanche. I have been intending
  to write to Emma, and I will really write soon; but in the hot
  weather one feels terribly indisposed for letter-writing, and I have
  quite quill-work enough to do every day. Our kindest love to
  yourself and Horace, and to Jane and Sophia; and many kisses from
  our little darling.

  I was very pleased and comforted by your last affectionate letter.
  Bitterly indeed do I miss you! Had I given way to my own selfish
  wishes, I think I should not have allowed you to return to school.
  Your dear aunt, however, who is now looking carefully after my
  domestic affairs, showed me so plainly that by keeping you at home I
  should be depriving you of the advantages of education, that I
  sacrificed my feelings for your sake. On reflection, also, I hoped
  that you would find some little consolation and comfort from
  association with young ladies of your own age, for here all is
  cheerless and dreary. The void caused by your dear mother's death
  can never be refilled; my home is truly desolate. It would have been
  wrong to keep you at home to share my grief, and thus uselessly add
  bitterness to your younger years. Do not grieve too long and
  bitterly, my child, for your dearly loved mother; imitate her in
  every action of her life; and when Time has slightly moderated your
  poor father's sorrow, and you are in charge of his home and your
  own, things may be brighter and more cheerful again.

  MY DEAR DAUGHTER,


  When you left home for service, you were so young and inexperienced
  that we were most anxious as to your welfare. We are truly thankful
  to find from your letter, received a few days ago, that you are in a
  place that is likely to prove comfortable. I need not give you much
  advice as to obedience, for you have always been, both to your

  is very kind in showing you how to perform your duties. Be
  attentive, and grateful to her for such kindness.

  Do not make acquaintances too hurriedly; never stay out later than
  the hour appointed for you to be at home; and on no account whatever
  admit any one into the house, without first obtaining leave from
  your mistress. Never miss an opportunity of attending Divine
  worship. Write to us as often as you can; and with the love of your
  mother and myself,

  child in one short moment! Your dear wife, we are well aware (as far
  as human beings can form a judgment of the lives of their fellow
  creatures) was in every act, deed, and word a true Christian. Your
  account of her death is deeply touching; but how grateful you must
  have felt to have seen her so resigned and happy in the thought
  that, although her loss would cast a shadow on your life on earth,
  you would meet her hereafter in that better world, where no trouble
  or sorrow is to be found. She was good in every acceptation of the
  term: her charities (so unostentatiously dispensed), her cheerful
  willingness to relieve any real distress, her talents and charms,
  endeared her to all. Naturally you must deeply grieve for the loss
  of one so dear and excellent. You have again another source of grief
  in the loss of your child; dear J----, and at present all
  consolation must seem to you impossible; but God has ordained that
  Time shall bring comfort and soothing for all earthly sorrows, and
  to its healing influence we must leave you. As soon as you feel
  equal to the journey, come to us, and stay as long as you feel
  inclined. We will walk and ride together. There is great healing in
  Nature, and open-air exercise--I speak from experience--does as much
  as reason and philosophy in soothing a great grief.

  My wife unites with me in best regards and truest sympathy.


  I am ever,

  Dear J----,

  Yours most truly,

  MY DEAR ----,


  Every morning we listen for the post with the greatest anxiety,
  trusting that it will bring us better news of your dear brother. The
  accounts yesterday gave us a very lively idea of your situation,
  while you are expecting so critical and dangerous an hour as that
  which you have in view. We deeply feel for you, yet we know you are
  and will be supported. We pray for you and your brother, and we know
  and believe that He on whom we call is rich in mercy and mighty to
  save. We see many around us who have been restored from the very
  gates of the grave when every human effort has proved ineffectual.
  This gives us hopes that our supplications may terminate in praises
  for your dear brother's restoration to health.

  MY DEAR ----,


  We were all very glad to find on Martha's return yesterday that you
  would come on Saturday, and we trust we may induce you to stay until
  Monday.

  I enclose you a list of the departure and arrival of the trains. The
  launch takes place at three o'clock, but (if you can manage it) you
  had better come early, that you may have a rest after your journey.
  Let us know at what time you propose leaving London, and we will
  meet you at the station. It appears to me the one leaving at 10.30,
  and arriving at 11.30, is the best, as you will only be an hour on
  the road. However, let us know.

  We unite in kindest love to all, and best regards to A----

  DEAR SIR,


  I should feel much obliged if you would use your influence with the
  churchwardens to procure me a pew or sittings for myself and family
  in the Parish Church. I need not point out to you the inconvenience
  arising from not having one allotted to me. I purposed making a
  formal application to the churchwardens, but being a stranger to
  them all, I believe a word from you would procure them for me. For
  some weeks I have been confined to the house from indisposition, or
  I would have done myself the pleasure of making my request in
  person.

  Stalybridge, May 1st, 187--

  DEAR GEORGE,


  You will, I am certain, be very sorry to hear that for the last six
  weeks I have been confined to the house with a severe attack of
  rheumatic gout. You, who so well know my active habits, can
  thoroughly enter into my feelings at being a prisoner for so long a
  time. The agony I have suffered has been excruciating; I was unable
  to move without assistance, and was as feeble as an infant, being
  unable to do the most trifling thing for myself. But you will be
  glad to hear that I received the greatest kindness and attention
  from our friends. I was unable to hold a book or a newspaper, but
  every morning one or the other of this kind family with whom I am
  staying tried to relieve the monotony of my life by reading to me;
  in the afternoon some of them would come and tell me the news; and
  in the evening, whilst I sat propped up on a sofa, the charming
  daughters would sing and play. I feel grieved to remember the
  inconvenience and annoyance I must have been to them all, and shall
  be happy indeed when I can be moved; as, although they are so
  extremely kind, I feel what a tremendous amount of additional labour
  I must cause to all the household. Never can I forget the attention
  and kindness shown me. I shall be very glad to see you when you come
  home. Have you had much civility shown you at P----? It used to be a
  very nice place when I lived there.


  Believe me,

  DEAR JAMES,


  I am sorry to hear you have had such a severe attack. Nothing is so
  trying to a man of active habits, like yourself, as confinement to
  the house. It was fortunate for you that you were not laid up during
  the best part of the hunting season, as I am afraid your patient
  spirit would have utterly rebelled against your privation from one
  of the only things you really enjoy. We are very snug indeed here,
  and are made a great deal of. We need never be at home unless we
  choose. Your friends the Ducrows have a very nice house near, and
  they have introduced me to some very pleasant people. One of their
  daughters is a very charming girl. We sing duets together; and as we
  have to practise for some musical parties, I see a great deal of
  her. You would like her, I think. I hope we may remain here some
  time longer, as it is not often one meets with such real friendship
  as the people here have shown us. I send you a few papers which may
  amuse you. I hope to hear soon that you are better. When you are
  able to travel I shall be glad to see you here; I can put you up
  very comfortably.


  Believe me,

  MY DEAR JOHN,


  You must not measure the real pleasure and gratification it afforded
  me to receive your letter by the time I have taken to answer it. I
  have meant many times to sit down and write to you, but one thing or
  the other has prevented me. The chief cause of my silence, I grieve
  to say, has been the fresh sorrows we have lately had, in the loss
  of our dear little pet, a boy of nearly one year old, during
  teething, and then the break-up of our little comfortable home in
  consequence of this--for my dear wife was quite broken by it, in
  health and spirits; and requiring change of air, I sent her and our
  eldest girl to Dawlish, where they are now comfortably established
  with my brother's family, and I sincerely hope the change will
  prove beneficial to them both. There are many of our old Durham
  friends residing there, which will be pleasant for her. I shall be
  so completely tied by business here for some weeks, or it may be
  longer, that I can scarcely fix the time I shall join them. I shall
  be dull enough alone, you may well imagine. Forgive my apparent
  neglect, and if you should be passing near be good enough to give me
  a call. We are a party of about seven in this boarding-house. The
  terms are very moderate, and if you know any friend requiring
  accommodation in one, I can vouch for their being comfortable here.
  Best regards to your wife and daughters.

  DEAR FELLOWES,


  As you are well up in everything relating to diseases in dogs, I

  vaccinating him I shall ward off the distemper. Do you think it
  would prove efficacious? I should be sorry to lose him. Perhaps you
  will drop me a line when you have time. You are generally so
  occupied that it is scarcely fair to trouble you, but I think you
  will in this case excuse your old friend. Have you seen anything of
  Doxman lately? He was here last week.

  Tipnor, 10th March, 187--

  DEAR PURCHASE,


  I have always leisure to give a friend a hint if I think it possible
  to be useful, so I lose no time in replying to you about your pup
  and the distemper. I have tried vaccination and found it a perfect
  fallacy, and many of my friends, real judges of dogs, and one of
  whom is frequently appealed to on matters of dispute with regard to
  their treatment, decidedly says he has no faith in it, and that the
  effects are nothing. One of my friends had some dogs which all
  escaped distemper, but that was attributed to his never giving them
  any animal food. I rarely have a case (among my dogs) of distemper,
  and if I do it is generally very mild, and I account for it from my
  mode of feeding them. Until they reach the age of twelve months I
  keep them entirely, or nearly so, on bread and milk, potatoes,
  cabbage, meal, and milk, with the very slightest quantity imaginable
  of flesh food. Do not keep your dog too closely confined; feed him
  as I advise, and he may escape distemper altogether. Should he not,
  it will not be so severe as if you had fed him entirely on meat. I
  shall be coming into your neighbourhood shortly, and will pay you a
  visit.


  Believe me,

  Yours sincerely,

  DEAR SIR,


  In reply to your letter of the 11th inst. relative to the Pulwood
  estate, in Chancery, I think that your first step is to ascertain in
  whose Court the suit is pending. You can discover this by searching
  at the Record and Writ Clerks' Courts, in Chancery Lane. You must
  then ascertain by search in Chambers of the Judge to whose Court the
  suit is attached, to what stage the proceedings have advanced, and,
  if no certificate has issued finding the heir or heirs, you must
  make out your pedigree, by searching parish and other registers, old
  family Bibles, &c., and obtain also all the evidence you possibly
  can in support of it; but you had better employ a solicitor. I trust
  you will be successful.

  me advise you, if you intend trying a course of water-drinking or
  bathing at the foreign spas, not to select any particular place or
  bath merely from a description given in a book, however good or
  reliable it may be, so much depends on individual cases and
  constitutions. Consult first some physician who has made the foreign
  baths his particular study.

  The Elms, Whitchurch, Feb. 15th, 187--

  DEAR SIR,


  I am this moment returned from Nantwich, having travelled part of
  the way last night from B----. The house there did not quite satisfy
  me, but if the trustees of the late owner will do what is required,
  the place may be made suitable. I looked over the house, grounds,
  and furniture, and my chief objection is to the want of finish about
  the grounds. With the house itself I am quite satisfied, and the
  furnishing of the ground floor requires no special remark; but the
  bedrooms appear rather defective. Some rooms I could not see, on
  account of the indisposition of the present tenant. On the whole my
  notion of the value is about £-- per annum, which, if entertained, I
  should be disposed to give, supposing the trustees will do all I
  require.

  I should prefer renting the house for a twelvemonth's occupancy,
  with option to make it five years. I shall be in London next week,
  and will fix a day for calling on you if you think it likely we may
  come to terms. I of course assume that the house would be fully

  SIR,


  I received yours of the 4th inst., and am extremely sorry to hear of
  the death of my old friend, your late employer, but at the same time
  very much pleased to find that his business has fallen into such
  good hands as yours. You have double advantages over a stranger, as
  you are well acquainted with your late employer's trade and
  customers, which, by his transactions with me, appear to be very
  extensive. I have sent your order in ten bales marked D.P., by the
  8.40 train, and you will find them as good as your best customers
  can desire. I am very glad you wish to keep up the old connexion.
  Wishing you every success,

  _From a Young Tradesman, asking Advice in Difficulties._


  Commercial Road, June 12th, 187--

  DEAR SIR,


  I am encouraged by my knowledge of your kindness to ask your advice
  with regard to the difficulties which at present surround me.

  On commencing business, about four years since, everything looked
  bright and prosperous, but the pressure put upon me now, in
  consequence of the many bankruptcies that have lately taken place,
  has brought me to the very brink of misery and ruin. I see no
  prospect before me but to compound with my creditors, and _that_ I
  would by any possibility avoid. Knowing the interest you have always
  taken in me, and being well aware that your advice and assistance
  are most valuable, I now venture to apply to you. I have dreaded to
  do so, as it appeared to me that I was, as it were, imposing upon
  your too compassionate heart. However, now, dear sir, you know the
  whole of my circumstances, and exactly the position in which I find
  myself, through no fault of my own. I shall anxiously await your
  reply. With many thanks for past undeserved kindness,


  I remain,

  Dear Sir,

  Yours most respectfully,

  H. S. F.

  DEAR SIR,


  Having admired you for your upright dealings ever since you
  commenced business, I am sorry to hear of your present difficulties.
  There are but two courses open to you--bankruptcy or composition.
  Compound with your creditors, as the best and only means of showing
  your honesty of purpose, and also because it will save them the
  expenses caused by bankruptcy. I will do all in my power to arrange
  matters for you. My own claim I will not at present press, and very
  possibly when everything is settled you may find yourself in a much
  less distressing position than you at present imagine. Let me see
  you as soon as you can. Keep nothing back from me.


  Yours truly,

  _From a Man with a small Capital intending to go into Business,
  asking for Advice._


  Penge, April 5th, 187--

  DEAR MR. MATTHEWS,


  Having within the last few weeks received a very handsome legacy, I
  am thinking of endeavouring to increase it by going into business.
  For some years, you are aware, I was with Messrs. Piper and Co., and
  I imagine I might derive benefit from their connexion. I am well
  convinced, from your practical knowledge, you will give me such
  information as will prevent my getting into difficulties. I presume
  I must be cautious, in starting in business, not to sink too much of
  my funds in a large stock at first, as there may be a doubt that the
  return would not be sufficiently speedy to cover my outlay, and
  consequently I should be obliged to draw upon my capital for
  household expenses. There is another point on which I wish your
  advice, and that is as to the locality in which I should take a
  business. Do you recommend a new neighbourhood, or not? Will you
  also give me some hints as to the sort of connexion I should
  endeavour to obtain? and doubtless you will oblige me in giving me a
  few general directions as to the best mode of succeeding in my
  undertaking.


  I remain,

  Dear Sir,

  Yours respectfully,

  D. T----.


  ----


  _Reply to Young Man intending to go into Business._


  Tarnham, May 4th, 187--

  DEAR MR. THOMAS,


  I was glad to receive your letter, and glad to find you have
  confided in your father's old friend for advice, under the
  circumstance of your starting in business. You do not tell me the
  amount of your capital; but whether large or small, the same rule
  should be adopted;--you must be very careful in the matter of
  investing your money, for without great precaution and judgment you
  may be a considerable loser. Do not lay in too large a stock. Should
  trade prove slack, the rent and taxes of your premises must be paid;
  the stock lies idle and deteriorates in value; and when once you dip
  into your capital there will be little prospect of your recovering
  yourself again.

  With regard to a locality, you must be guided very much by the
  number of the inhabitants, the nature of the neighbourhood, the
  requirements and the customs of the resident population; and if
  possible you should ascertain whether there is any one in the same
  business who may already have obtained the best connexion. Many
  small capitalists, in going into a new neighbourhood, have been
  bitterly disappointed in their expectations of making a good
  connexion. It is really a fact, that the first shops established in
  a new place generally fail. Should your neighbourhood be a poor one,
  guard against laying in a supply of luxuries. Necessaries will be
  certain to sell. Being agent to one of the large wine firms that
  supply grocers is a great advantage, as many a customer coming for
  wine is induced to purchase another article. There is one thing
  necessary to success in business, and that is civility, an amount
  of which in stock will cost nothing. And by treating all your
  customers, rich and poor, with due deference but not servility, you
  will find your custom very much increase. Let your customers see
  that it is a pleasure for you to oblige, and that it is not done
  with a view only of selfish greed or gain. Should you require advice
  at any future time, I shall be very glad indeed to give you any
  information you may require.

  I will close my letter with one more word of counsel, which is
  this--do not get into debt. Wishing you every success,


  Believe me,

  Your sincere friend,

  Yours of the 4th was duly received, and the goods therein mentioned

  advertised them for sale in twelve different lots, but they were all
  bought up by one of the principal manufacturers in Spitalfields for
  a good sum, which I have lodged in the bank to your credit. I
  forwarded last week, by the _Orion_, the different articles you
  ordered. There are twenty bales, marked "A. X." I am told, by judges
  in the trade, that they are the best and cheapest that can be had. I

  DEAR ----,


  We had a tolerable supply of wheat at market to-day; there was
  rather a limited attendance, however, and business on the whole
  proceeded slowly. Most of the samples exhibited were in poor
  condition; and this, coupled with the sluggish demand, caused prices
  to give way from one to two shillings per quarter. Foreign wheat had
  but a dull inquiry. In the flour market there was a moderate
  consumptive business done, at about late terms; best descriptions of
  malting and grinding barleys were held for rather higher terms,
  with a quiet demand. I shall be in your neighbourhood on Sunday, and
  will give you a call.

  Bradford, January 17th, 187--

  DEAR ----,


  We are looking up, as there is a very good tone prevailing in the
  wool market, and a very fair amount of business has been done during
  the past week. The late advancing rates, consequent upon the high
  prices of country dealers, tend to check operations, which are quite
  of a consumptive character. Very good wethers continue in demand.
  Hogs are rather more in favour. Skin wool is also in fair request;
  pieces are very stiff. Hughes' sale the other day fully sustained
  the tendency of the market, both as respects demands and quotations.
  I will not lose an opportunity, believe me.


  I remain,

  Yours sincerely,

  SIR,


  I was very sorry, on the last receipt of a parcel forwarded by you,
  to be obliged to find fault with some of the goods, which were not
  at all up to sample that was sent about two months since. You
  assured me, at the same time, that in future there should be no
  cause for complaint. Since then I have received my last order, and
  there is, if possible, a greater inferiority in some of the articles
  than on the previous occasion. I do not, believe me, complain
  without cause; my customers are disposed, I fear, to leave me, not
  being satisfied with the quality of the articles I sell. If you will
  make some reduction in price, I will retain those I have now;
  otherwise, however unwilling I may be to do so, I must return them.
  Awaiting an early reply,


  I remain, Sir,

  For some years previous to the late war I was employed by Messrs.
  ---- and ----, and was selected by their French correspondents to
  manage a branch establishment at B----, which is now progressing
  most satisfactorily. I am a good correspondent in French and Italian
  and German, and understand the business well in all its branches.

  Trusting that you will favourably consider my friend's
  recommendation,


  I remain, Gentlemen,

  Yours faithfully,

  SIR,


  In reply to yours respecting the advertisement in yesterday's
  _Times_, the appointment referred to was to fill up a vacancy in the
  Board of an established Brewery Company, "limited," and one which
  has the prospect of more than ordinary success. All the parties
  connected with it are of the highest respectability. ---- pounds are
  required to be invested in paid-up shares, and the remuneration of a
  director would probably be £---- per annum. There is one appointment
  also connected with this, worth £---- per annum; but the individual
  who takes this is expected to introduce £---- on share or loan
  capital. Should this be likely to suit you, please make an
  appointment for an early interview.


  Yours faithfully,

  Having lately been engaged in the office of S---- and Co.,
  auctioneers and surveyors in B----, and wishing to remove to London,
  where I have some very influential friends, I write to ascertain if
  you have a vacancy in your office. The whole control of the business

  Having seen that Mr. B---- has retired from your firm, I beg to
  introduce to your notice a friend of mine, who wishes to invest
  about 2000_l._ in a lucrative business. I have pointed out to him
  what a well established house yours is, and how the business could
  be readily increased by the assistance of an energetic partner. He
  is a man of education, has a great turn for business, and has
  travelled abroad. He is about thirty years of age, and can give you
  the most unexceptionable references. If you can call on me I will
  introduce him to you.

  DEAR SIR,


  We have been expecting to hear from you _re_ the above, giving us
  instructions as to whether we shall put it up in the Mart this
  spring or not. If it is still your intention to do so, may we ask
  that you will kindly let us know at once, as we will then
  immediately get our bills out, and have them posted about, as this
  is generally requisite a month or two before the sale, so as to have
  it well advertised.

  If you would kindly favour us with a call, we shall be glad to
  confer with you upon the subject.

  We may mention we are expecting to have several other estates for
  sale by auction in the spring.

  An early call or reply would greatly oblige,

  DEAR MADAM,


  You will of course have observed, by the announcement in the
  newspapers of this day's date, that the business we have been so
  anxious about is settled. I do not wish to enlarge on my own humble
  services in the cause; but I am sure you will admit that if a
  professional gentleman had been employed, the advice and services I
  have rendered during the last few years would have been made into a
  very lengthy bill, far exceeding the amount you promised me,
  whatever the issue of the negotiations might be. I am well assured
  that I am in good hands, however, and had I been called upon to
  render ten times the required services and advice, you would have
  found me as ready and willing as I have been. Your kind favour of
  the --ult., enclosing cheque, was duly received. I need not say how
  glad I shall be to hear again from you at your earliest convenience.

  _Letter from a Traveller at Manchester, to his Employers in London._


  Manchester, January 18th, 187--

  DEAR SIRS,


  During the week very little change has taken place in prices quoted
  in my last. Cotton was a shade better on Monday, which caused
  sellers of yarn and cloth in this market to ask rather more in some
  instances; but the improvement was quite evanescent. The market,
  however, has continued steady. Some buyers have made attempts to
  operate at rather lower prices, and offers have been freely made at
  1/8_d._ to 1/4_d._ per lb. for yarns, but the offers have only been
  made in exceptional cases. For goods of all descriptions,
  notwithstanding some discouraging accounts from abroad, very
  considerable contracts for distant delivery in point of time could
  have been secured by making a very slight concession.

  Madapollams, jaconets, and mulls are not in active request, but
  maintain last week's values. Printers T cloths and domestics meet
  with a fair consumptive demand, and orders can only be placed at the
  prices of Tuesday. Large importations of cotton, and lower prices,
  are causing buyers to operate cautiously, both in yarn and cloth. I
  leave this to-morrow for MacClesfield.


  I remain, Gentlemen,

  Yours obediently,

  I send my coachman to consult with you as to the style and quality

  you the size of the horses; and please let me know by him the very
  lowest price.

  This admits of the following change, according to circumstances:
  instead of "three months after date," it may be "at sight," or at
  such a time "after sight," or at such a specified time, or "on
  demand;" and the instruction to pay may be "to A. B. or order."

  The naming of the payee admits of the same variations as are

  be, in like manner, variously expressed. The term "usance" is
  sometimes employed to express the period of running in foreign
  bills. It means a certain time fixed by custom as between any two
  places, and the period covered by a usance will therefore depend on
  the places of drawing and payment.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
