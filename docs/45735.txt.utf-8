=LINUS WEED BROWN, M. Am. Soc. C.E.[1]=

DIED MARCH 7TH, 1910.

In the death of Linus Weed Brown, which occurred in Monrovia, Cal., on
March 7th, 1910, this Society lost one of its valued members and the
Engineering Profession a most able exponent.

Mr. Brown was born in Burnside, Orange County, N.Y., in August, 1856,
and received his early education in the schools of that town. He
studied his profession in the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken,
N.J.

At the age of eighteen he entered the machine shops of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, and later was employed as Draftsman by that Company, which
position he held until 1880.

In 1880 he accepted a position with the Southern Pacific Railroad in
New Orleans, La., and designed and supervised the construction of the
Algiers shops.

In 1883 Mr. Brown severed his connection with the Southern Pacific
Company and engaged in general engineering practice, principally in the
line of sugar-house installations.

In 1885 he was elected Assistant City Engineer of New Orleans, which
position he held for four years.

In 1890 he became Chief Engineer for the Caffrey Central Sugar
Refinery, designing and supervising the erection of the buildings,
which represented an expenditure of about $600,000. In the same year
Mr. Brown was appointed Chief Engineer of the Franklin and Abbeville
Railroad and built that road. At the same time he designed and built
the Des Lignes sugar-house. In fact, he designed and built many of the
large sugar mills and refineries erected in Louisiana about that time.

From 1892 to 1896 Mr. Brown held the office of City Engineer of New
Orleans, and it was during this term that some of the most important
works of his career were accomplished.

Under the direction of the City Council, and in consultation with B.M.
Harrod, Past-President, Am. Soc. C.E., the late H.B. Richardson, M.
Am. Soc. C.E., and Rudolph Hering, M. Am. Soc. C.E., Mr. Brown made
a topographical survey of New Orleans, a study of precipitation and
run-off, and prepared plans and specifications for a drainage system.

At the expiration of his term of office as City Engineer, he engaged
in private practice, assuming charge, as Chief Engineer for the
contractors, of the first construction work of the drainage system.

Prior to and during his term of office as City Engineer, Mr. Brown was
Architect of the McDonogh School Fund in New Orleans, during which time
he designed and built several new schools and remodeled a number of old
buildings.

He was also Special Engineer for the New Orleans Levee Board on harbor
and bank protection work. To the study of this work Mr. Brown devoted
all his energies and knowledge for several years. At the same time he
was a member of the New Orleans Advisory Board of Engineers on Sewerage
and Water.

When the oil fields of Texas were first discovered, Mr. Brown's
services were immediately engaged, and in the following years he
devoted almost his entire time to the development of the oil fields and
facilities for handling the oil. His operations were principally in the
Beaumont and Sour Lake fields.

The holdings of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company in these regions
demanded the services of an expert engineer, and Mr. Brown was engaged
to take full charge of its interests.

In 1904 he was compelled to give up active business and seek the
restoration of his health. To this end he spent some time in the Middle
Western States and finally decided to go out to the Pacific Coast.
The climate there proved so beneficial that he eventually settled in
Bakersfield, Cal., where he accepted an appointment as Consulting
Engineer for the Oil Department of the Southern Pacific Railroad and
Chief Engineer of the Atlantic Division of the same line.

Shortly after he accepted this appointment the Colorado River broke
through its banks and overflowed the valley known as the Salton Sea,
across which the tracks of the Southern Pacific Road were laid. The
Company was compelled to make a detour of approximately 100 miles
around the inundated region, but, under the direction of Mr. Brown,
they succeeded in closing the break with two massive dams, confining
the river to its ordinary channel and preventing the increase of the
Salton Sea.

While in California Mr. Brown invented an oil and sand separator, which
the Southern Pacific Company is now using throughout its oil fields. He
also invented a continuous water purifier and a special oil power-pump.
All these machines are now on the market.

Mr. Brown was a man of sterling integrity; one who regarded his
profession in the light of an obligatory public service. To this sense
of duty he sacrificed much, primarily the necessary relaxation and rest
from arduous labor, which undoubtedly accelerated the end of his useful
and honorable career.

In recognition of the valuable services he rendered in connection
with the levee protection work in New Orleans, Mr. Brown was made the
recipient of public honors and testimonials of appreciation.

He is survived by a daughter and two sons; the latter are preparing
to follow the engineering profession. His wife, who was Miss Joan Von
Vesterfeldt of New York City, died in 1903.

Mr. Brown was elected a Member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers on June 7th, 1899. He was also a Member of the Louisiana
Engineering Society.

=JOHN HENDERSON SAMPLE, M. Am. Soc. C.E.=[3]

DIED MARCH 4TH, 1910.


John Henderson Sample, the only son of Judge William Sample, was born
on April 3d, 1849, at Coshocton, Ohio. He entered Dennison University,
Granville, Ohio, from which he was graduated in 1872. After leaving
college, he was engaged on the early surveys of the Toledo and Ohio
Central lines, working up from Axeman to Division Engineer.

Afterward Mr. Sample served as Chief Engineer of the Cincinnati,
Lebanon, and Northern Railway, and Chief Engineer of the Cincinnati
and Georgia (now the Southern Railway), from Rome to Macon, Ga.,
except from Austell to Atlanta. In 1883, he made surveys for the East
Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railway (now the Southern Railway)
in Alabama. He then became Chief Engineer of the Alabama Improvement
Company, engaged in the location and construction of the Northern
Alabama Railroad, and the development of coal and ore lands and the
Town of Sheffield, Ala.

He was appointed Chief Engineer of the Toledo and Ann Arbor, on
location and construction from Hammond Junction to Durand; Chief
Engineer of location and construction of the Missouri Pacific lines in
Kansas, Colorado, and Missouri; and from 1887 to 1889, he served as
Chief Engineer on the construction of the Louisville, Henderson, and
St. Louis Railway, from West Point to Henderson, Ky.

Mr. Sample made examinations and reports on timber and mineral lands
in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, and in 1889, he
examined and reported on the Mexican National Railroad, from Laredo,
Tex., to the City of Mexico.

From 1889 to 1896, he was Chief Engineer of location and construction
and General Superintendent of operation of the Pittsburg, Akron,
and Western Railroad, from Delphos to Akron, Ohio. In 1897 he was
appointed General Superintendent of the Cleveland, Akron, and Columbus
Railroad, which position he held until this road was purchased by the
Pennsylvania Company, in September, 1899. From that date to the time of
his death, Mr. Sample was in the employ of the Pennsylvania Company,
as Assistant Engineer, being engaged on line and grade revision and
special work.

His father being a lawyer and Judge, he partook of his judicial nature,
and all his lifework was based on the broad foundation of equity and
honesty of purpose. He was a man of unobtrusive manner, retiring
disposition, and unpretentious ways.

On June 7th, 1876, Mr. Sample was married to Miss Virginia Hughes. His
wife died on June 24th, 1889.

Mr. Sample died suddenly in the Fort Pitt Hotel, at Pittsburg, Pa., on
March 4th, 1910. He intended to leave for New York City during the day
to bid farewell to his son, who was Assistant Engineer on the Madeira
and Mamoré Railway, in Brazil, and had been spending his vacation of
three months with his father.

To his children, and to those who knew him intimately, Mr. Sample
leaves a memory of a life well rounded out by noble endeavor, and a
fixedness of purpose to know and do the right. He was conscientious in
every act and thought, a man of deep religious conviction, and though
called suddenly from his earthly labors, he was ready for the higher
service and duty.

Mr. Sample was elected a Member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers on October 6th, 1886.

=JACOBUS VAN DER HOEK, M. Am. Soc. C.E.=[5]

DIED DECEMBER 22D, 1909.


Jacobus Van der Hoek, son of the late Gysbertus Van der Hoek and
Johanna (Tupers) Van der Hoek, was born at Goes, The Netherlands,
on March 19th, 1862. He received his early education at the Public
Schools, and was graduated from the High School of his native town in
August, 1879. In September of the same year he entered the Polytechnic
School at Delft, The Netherlands, from which he was graduated, as Civil
Engineer, in July, 1883.

During 1884 Mr. Van der Hoek was employed as Inspector on the
construction of a dike across the "het slaak," a shallow tidewater
1-1/2 miles wide, and made surveys and soundings for a record map of
adjacent waters covering an area of 6 sq. miles.

In 1885 and 1886 he was employed by the Dutch Government as Assistant
Engineer in charge of a party, to re-survey the principal rivers of
Holland, and triangulated about 25 miles of river.

During 1887 Mr. Van der Hoek was Engineer in charge of the submarine
shore protection for the "Polder of Schouwen," The Netherlands. In 1887
he left his native land for the United States, arriving in New York
City, on December 25th.

From the latter part of 1888 to the beginning of 1890, he was employed
by the Wheeling Bridge and Terminal Railway Company, at Wheeling, W.
Va., under the late Job Abbott, M. Am. Soc. C.E., Chief Engineer.
The work comprised steam railway construction, a bridge 2,000 ft. in
length, including one span over the Ohio River, 525 ft. long, and three
tunnels from 400 to 2,400 ft. long, all double-track and heavy work
throughout. The Engineer who was in charge of the work, writes:

    "Mr. Van der Hoek reported to me as Chief Draftsman and
    Office Assistant during the period above mentioned. He was so
    capable and earnest in all of his work, and so well qualified
    to perform it, that our relations were not only uniformly
    pleasant, but they marked the beginning of a friendship that
    lasted until the deplorable end of Mr. Van der Hoek's useful
    life."

In 1890, Mr. Van der Hoek entered the service of the Lehigh Valley
Railroad and continued with this Company until July, 1909; during
this time he was successively engaged as Chief Draftsman, Assistant,
Resident, and Division Engineer. During the extension of the main line
of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, from Sayre to Buffalo, he was employed
as Chief Draftsman, designing masonry and other structures, also as
Assistant and Resident Engineer in charge of certain sections of the
line. Paul S. King, M. Am. Soc. C.E., the Chief Engineer in charge
of the construction of this 175 miles of double-track railroad, soon
recognized the exceptional engineering ability of Mr. Van der Hoek, and
appointed him, successively, Assistant and Resident Engineer in charge
of several sections; of his success and ability, Mr. King writes:

    "The sad and sudden death of Mr. Van der Hoek was indeed
    a great shock to me and his many friends in the Lehigh
    Valley System, particularly in New York State, his field of
    professional work for so many years.

    "I highly regarded his technical ability, sterling character,
    and untiring industry, both in the field and office. During the
    time he was engaged with me (nearly four years), he filled the
    positions of Chief Draftsman, Assistant, and Resident Engineer,
    and earned the respective promotions by the zeal and energy
    which was always characteristic of him with any work he had
    in hand. He continued throughout the period of construction,
    a record not equalled by any of the dozen or more Resident
    Engineers connected with that work. It was this observation of
    his conduct and activity in executing his work that warranted
    me to have confidence in his ability to take up the work to be
    done after the Operating Department took charge of the line,
    recommending him as the Engineer for Maintenance of Way of part
    of the new line."

In 1893, Mr. Van der Hoek was appointed Division Engineer of the
Buffalo Division of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and had charge, under
the Superintendent of Maintenance of Way, of constructing stations,
water stations, coal trestles, wharves, stone ballasting the line,
building storage yards, rebuilding bridges, etc.; he continued in this
position until July 1st, 1909.

One of his associates on the Lehigh Valley Railroad writes:

    "I was intimately acquainted with Mr. Van der Hoek and his
    work from 1894 to the time of his death, and as a co-worker
    on the Lehigh Valley Railroad it is a privilege to testify to
    his exceptional engineering ability, his strong, unflinching
    character, his untiring energy, and implicit adherence to the
    lines of duty. He had exceptional executive ability combined
    with a thorough knowledge of details. It was these qualities
    that made him so successful in his work.

    "Mr. Van der Hoek was a sober, unassuming, and honest man, a
    generous and respected superior to his subordinates, a true
    friend, ever ready to assist an aspiring young man to greater
    knowledge and better positions; by these he will be truly
    missed and mourned."

On July 12th, 1909, Mr. Van der Hoek entered the service of the Lehigh
Coal and Navigation Company, as Civil Engineer, under the General
Superintendent of that company, at Lansford, Pa., to take charge of
the railroad maintenance, water supply, land surveys, and new outside
construction, on the extensive mining properties of that company in the
anthracite coal fields.

Mr. Van der Hoek's exceptional ability was thoroughly recognized by
his new employers, and his work and its results were fully appreciated;
he had but laid his plans and perfected a proper organization when,
on the afternoon of December 22d, 1909, while inspecting the work of
laying a new water main through the Lansford, Pa., tunnel, he met his
death by being run over by an engine, and his successful professional
career was thus sadly ended. His Assistant, who had accompanied him on
this inspection, met with the same lamentable fate.

On May 30th, 1896, Mr. Van der Hoek was married, in New York City, to
Johanna Van der Bent, and is survived by his wife and two children.

He was elected a Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers on
April 7th, 1897.

=LUTHER ELMAN JOHNSON, Jun, Am. Soc. C.E.=[6]

DIED MARCH 23D, 1910.


By the death of Luther Elman Johnson, the Engineering Profession has
lost a bright and able young engineer whose career, though short, gave
promise of a steady rise and a brilliant future.

Mr. Johnson, the son of Mr. and Mrs. M.D. Johnson, of Lawton, Okla.,
was born in Union, West Va., on August 10th, 1881. Most of his
childhood and early manhood, however, were spent in Missouri. He
received his High School training at Nevada, Mo., and his technical
education at the Missouri State University, from which he was graduated
in 1904, on his completion of the four years' course in Civil
Engineering. In connection with the training at the University, Mr.
Johnson, on graduation, was appointed and commissioned Brevet Second
Lieutenant, in the National Guard of Missouri, by the Governor of the
State.

His professional work began shortly after graduation, with his
employment in the United States Reclamation Service, in connection with
investigations of reservoir sites for the storage of irrigation water
in Oklahoma. Following this, Mr. Johnson was transferred to the Garden
City, Kans., pumping project, where, from 1905 to 1907, he was engaged
in concrete construction and other work. In the latter part of 1907,
he was transferred to the Minidoka, Idaho, pumping project, where, as
Assistant Engineer, he was engaged until shortly before his death.

His work on the latter project was in connection with the location and
construction of canals, and he was in active charge of the building
of a large number of small reinforced concrete and timber structures
and bridges for the irrigation system. In prosecuting this work, Mr.
Johnson showed ability of the first order, and gave evidence, by his
conscientious, thorough, and careful work, of great promise for the
future.

In March, 1910, his health failing, he returned to his home in Lawton,
Okla., to recuperate from a general breakdown, but pneumonia set in,
and he died on March 23d.

Mr. Johnson was a young man of sterling qualities and rugged honesty;
his life was clean and strong, his character sweet and lovable, and his
capabilities exceptional. Untiring devotion to and interest in his work
were traits which had won for him the deepest respect of his associates
and those who worked under his direction, and his death was a keen
loss, not only to his family to whom he was a devoted son and brother,
but to his many friends and to all those with whom his work brought him
in contact.

Mr. Johnson was elected a Junior of the American Society of Civil
Engineers on September 6th, 1904.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
