_PREFACE._


Amidst the laudable endeavours for the advancement of the Italian
language, it is surprising that an easy and expeditious method
of teaching it has been, in a great measure, neglected; and that
beginners have hitherto been left without proper assistance. Under
this impression, I have composed these EXERCISES upon the Syntax of
VENERONI’S _Italian Grammar_; with what success I have executed the
task, must be submitted to the decision of qualified and impartial
judges.

These Exercises comprehend all the difficulties, and idiomatical
expressions of the Italian language; the rules and exceptions of which
are exemplified after such a method, that a learner cannot fail to
become master of that language who has carefully gone through them once
or twice.

The examples are of three sorts; the first, immediately following
the rule, are short: as nothing farther is designed by them, than to
illustrate that particular rule. The second sort are longer, and in
them, not only the rule to which they refer, is exemplified, but also
the foregoing ones are again brought into practice, the better to
imprint them on the memory: since, were it not for this contrivance,
learners would forget one rule, while they were learning another; the
examples of the third kind, contain all the preceding, and some of
the subsequent rules promiscuously; and for these reasons, are not to
be attempted, until the student has gone twice at least, through the
former part (for I think it advisable they should go through it more
than once).

The radical Italian words are interlined, a thing very useful and
requisite in a work of this nature, as well to save the trouble of
consulting Dictionaries, as to prevent the use of improper terms, and
wrong spelling, otherwise unavoidable; and those who wish to learn
the Italian language, will thereby be enabled to make a much quicker
progress than they could possibly do by the tedious task of searching
a Dictionary for the words they require.

I have frequently omitted such words as had been often mentioned
before, presuming there was no occasion for such repetition; and in
order to excite attention in learners, that they might recollect what
they had learned, and exert both their memory and judgment, or, on
memory failing them, have recourse to a Dictionary, as a last resource.
For these reasons, in the latter part of the Exercises, there are
scarcely any Italian words but _nouns_ and _verbs_, all the other parts
of speech having already been gone through.

There is added, by way of Appendix, an Abridgment of the Roman
History. As history is one of the most easy and entertaining parts of
literature, and as that of the ancient Romans is absolutely necessary
to a proper understanding of the Classics, I hope this addition will
prove highly beneficial to young beginners.

_N. B. Great pains have been taken to render this new Edition of
BOTTARELLI’S ITALIAN EXERCISES more perfect than any hitherto
published. In order to facilitate the Italian pronunciation, the words
have been accented according to the plan of VENERONI’S GRAMMAR; the
references to VENERONI have been compared, and carefully corrected,
and many new ones added, together with several Notes and Remarks. All
obsolete and improper phrases have been expunged; and the Chronology
of the Roman History has been improved by the addition of DATES to
each respective chapter: in short, on account of the many additions,
alterations, and improvements, this edition may almost be considered
as a new book, and a worthy companion of the celebrated Grammar of
VENERONI.

_The following Conjunctions prima che, acciocchè, finchè, per paura
che, sin che, benchè, purchè, a meno che, Iddío voglia che, require the

  that you may take courage, and learn well.
  acciochè     pigliáre corággio imparáre bene.

  correctly,    unless you study the rules.

  have all the other fine qualities that can make a man perfect.

  I always praised you very much before you became so idle; and I told you
    sempre lodáre      molto     prima  che diveníre pigro        dire
  several times that you would lose the good opinion every one had of you,
  più     volte                pérdere  buóno opinióne tutto avére
  unless you should be as diligent and careful as you were before.
  a meno che        éssere diligénte   premuróso      éssere prima.

  When I corrected you for your faults, it was not because I did not love
  quando corréggere             colpa      éssere  perchè            amáre
  you; on the contrary, it was to the end that you should employ your

  time well, and that you should be more diligent than you are now.

  soon as well as you.

  I do not believe so, unless you have learned all the rules of the

    dire     éssere     vero.

  It will be some time before you have read them.

  Would to God I had known you sooner, I should speak Italian well now:
  volésse Iddío      conóscere                 parláre Italiáno bene ora
  and although I had learned when I was young, yet I knew but very little

  of it, when I began with you.

  Perhaps it was not your master’s fault; for before I composed my
  forse      éssere       maéstro  colpa      prima che compórre
  grammar, I found but few that would learn grammatically.
  grammática trováre   poco           imparáre grammaticalménte.

_The Verb to use in English, signifies in Italian servírsi, assuefársi,
accostumársi; when it signifies servírsi, it is commonly followed by a

AN ABRIDGEMENT OF THE ROMAN HISTORY.




CHAP. I.

Of the ORIGIN of the ROMANS.

_(Year of the World, 2800--Before Christ, 1184.)_


All [1]nations [2]seem [3]willing to [4]derive [5]merit from the
[6]splendor of their [7]origin, and [8]where [9]history [10]is silent,
they [11]generally [12]supply the [13]defect with [14]fable. The
[15]Romans were [16]particularly [17]desirous of being [18]thought
[19]descended from the [20]Gods, [21]as if they would [22]hide the
[23]meanness of their [24]real [25]ancestry. [26]Æneas, the [27]son of
[28]Venus and [29]Anchises, having [30]escaped from the [31]destruction
of [32]Troy, [33]after [34]many [35]adventures and [36]dangers
[37]arrived in [38]Italy, [39]where he was [40]kindly [41]received
by [42]Latinus, [43]king of the [44]Latins, who [45]gave him his
[46]daughter [47]Lavinia in [48]marriage. Italy was [49]then [50]as
it is [51]now, [52]divided into a [53]number of [54]small [55]states,
[56]independent of [57]each other, and, [58]consequently, [59]subject
to [60]frequent [61]contentions [62]among themselves. [63]Turnus,
[64]king of the [65]Rutuli, was the [66]first who [67]opposed Æneas,
he having [68]long [69]made pretensions to Lavinia himself. A [70]war
[71]ensued, in which the [72]Trojan [73]hero was [74]victorious, and
[75]Turnus [76]slain. In [77]consequence of this, Æneas [78]built a
[79]city, which was [80]called [81]Lavinium, in [82]honour of his
[83]wife; and [84]some time after [85]engaging in another [86]war
[87]against [88]Mezentius, one of the [89]petty kings of the
[90]country, he was [91]conquered in his [92]turn, and [93]died in
[94]battle, after a [95]reign of four [96]years.

[97]Ascanius, his [98]son, [99]succeeded to the [100]kingdom, and to
him, Silvius, a [101]second son, [102]whom he had by Lavinia. It would
be [103]tedious to [104]recite a [105]dry [106]catalogue of the kings
that [107]followed, and of whom we [108]know [109]little more than
their [110]names; it will be [111]sufficient to [112]say, that the
[113]succession [114]continued for [115]near [116]four [117]hundred
[118]years in the [119]family, and that [120]Numitor was the [121]last
king of Alba.

_(Of the World, 3301--Before Christ, 753.)_


The [1]twelfth [2]king of the [3]Latins after [4]Æneas, was [5]Amulius,
who [6]circumvented his [7]brother [8]Numitor, to whom the [9]right of
[10]succession [11]appertained, upon the [12]account of his [13]age.
Numitor had an [14]only [15]daughter [16]called Sylvia, and [17]Romulus
and [18]Remus, [19]twin brothers, and founders of Rome, were, as it
is said in fable and history, the [20]sons of [21]Mars and Sylvia.
The children being [22]exposed by the [23]king’s [24]order, were
[25]privately [26]educated by one [27]Faustulus, a [28]shepherd. When
they were [29]grown up, they [30]slew Amulius, [31]restored their
[32]grandfather, to his [33]kingdom, and [34]built [35]Rome 753 years
before [36]Christ was [37]born.

Romulus, having [38]put his [39]rival brother to [40]death, [41]was
[42]proclaimed king by his [43]followers; and having [44]settled the
[45]state [46]affairs, and [47]being in want of females, he [48]seized
upon all the [49]young women that [50]came to [51]see the [52]public
[53]games at Rome; upon which a [54]terrible and long [55]war with the
[56]Sabines [57]ensued.

The [58]Cæninenses, [59]Antemnates, and [60]Crustumini were
[61]conquered; and [62]at last the [63]Sabines, under the
[64]conduct of [65]Tatius, [66]bearing hard upon the Romans, by the
[67]interposition of the [68]Sabine women who had been [69]detained at
Rome, it was [70]agreed upon [71]betwixt both [72]parties, [73]that
they should [74]jointly [75]inhabit Rome, and Romulus and Tatius should
[76]reign [77]together. Tatius being [78]slain six [79]years after,
Romulus reigned [80]alone, and [81]completed the [82]term of 38 years,
having conquered the [83]neighbouring cities. At last, [84]a great
[85]tempest [86]arising as he [87]held an [88]assembly at the [89]lake
of Caprea, [90]he was no where to be found, being [91]torn in pieces
by the [92]senators (as it was [93]generally [94]thought) to whom he
was [95]now [96]grown [97]odious on [98]account of his [99]cruelty.
He [100]first [101]divided the city into [102]thirty [103]curiæ, and
[104]three [105]tribes. The [106]poor he [107]put [108]under the
[109]protection of the [110]great, whom he [111]named [112]patricii.
He [113]triumphed [114]three times [115]over his [116]vanquished
[117]enemies; [118]first, over the Cæninenses, and Antemnates, in which
[119]war having [120]killed their [121]king [122]Acron [123]with his
own hand, he [124]consecrated his first [125]spoils to [126]Jupiter
Feretrius; [127]secondly, over the [128]Camerini; [129]thirdly, over
the [130]Fidenates, and [131]Veientes.

[132]After an [133]interregnum of a [134]year’s continuance, [135]Numa
Pompilius, a Sabine, [136]born at [137]Cures, was [138]chosen king
by the Romans, 714 years before [139]Christ was [140]born; [141]who
[142]applying himself to the [143]preservation of the public
[144]quiet, [145]instituted all the [146]religious [147]rites of
the Romans. He [148]made an [149]addition of two [150]months to the
year, which [151]till that time had [152]consisted of [153]ten, and
[154]reigned forty-three years.

[155]The third king of the Romans was [156]Tullus Hostilius, a [157]man
of a [158]restless temper, and [159]fit for nothing but war. He
[160]conquered the Albans, and [161]destroyed their city, after he had
first [162]removed the [163]inhabitants, and all their [164]substance
to Rome; and [165]torn to pieces, [166]tied [167]betwixt two
[168]chariots, [169]Metius Fusetius, [170]dictator of the [171]Albans,
[172]convicted of [173]treachery. He [174]triumphed [175]three times
over the Albans, the [176]Fidenates, and the Sabines. He [177]reigned
[178]thirty-two years, and [179]perished with his [180]wife, and
[181]whole family, by [182]a thunderbolt [183]from heaven.

The [184]fourth king that reigned at Rome was [185]Ancus Martius,
[186]grandson to Numa Pompilius, by whom the [187]Latins were
[188]subdued, and most of them [189]taken into the city, and
[190]settled in the [191]Aventine mount; [192]the Janiculum was
[193]fortified by him, a [194]bridge made over the [195]Tiber, and
Ostia [196]built. He reigned 24 years.

The [197]fifth king of Rome was [198]Tarquinius Priscus, the
[199]son of [200]Demaratus, a [201]Corinthian. He [202]came to Rome
from [203]Tarquinii, a [204]town of Etruria, [205]from whence he
was [206]called [207]Lucius Tarquinius. After he [208]came to the
[209]government, he [210]augmented the [211]senate, [212]subdued the
[213]twelve [214]nations of Etruria, and [215]borrowed from them
the [216]ensigns of [217]supreme [218]power, the [219]fasces; the
[220]trabea; the [221]curule chair; the [222]prætexta; and other
[223]things of that [224]kind. He was slain by the sons of [225]Ancus,
after he had reigned 38 years.

His [226]son-in-law Servius Tullius, the [227]sixth in [228]order,
[229]began his [230]reign in the year 577 before Christ. He was for
his [231]rare [232]endowments [233]preferred before those of the royal
[234]blood. He first [235]instituted the [236]census, and [237]ordered
it to be [238]kept [239]every five years; [240]divided the [241]people
into [242]classes, and [243]centuries, and [244]enlarged the city: and
after he had [245]governed the [246]kingdom with great [247]applause 44
years, he was [248]murdered through the [249]horrid [250]wickedness of
his own [251]daughter, and Tarquin his [252]son-in-law.

The [253]seventh and [254]last king that reigned at Rome was Tarquin,
[255]surnamed [256]the Proud, whom [257]most of the [258]old Roman
[259]authors [260]affirm to be the son of [261]Priscus; [262]but
[263]Dionysius [264]will have him to be his grandson. He [265]governed
the [266]kingdom he had [267]procured by his [268]wickedness [269]no
better than he got it, being [270]cruel to the [271]senators, and
his [272]other [273]subjects. He [274]conquered the [275]Volsci, the
Sabines, and Gabii; and having [276]built the [277]Capitol with the
[278]spoils of the cities he had [279]taken, he was [280]at last
[281]turned out of the city, and of his kingdom, for a [282]violence
[283]committed by his [284]son upon [285]Lucretia.

CHAP. III

(_Of the World, 3545--Of Rome, 245._)


[1]King Tarquin, with his [2]family, being [3]banished, [4]L. Junius
Brutus, and [5]L. Tarquinius Collatinus were [6]made [7]consuls.
[8]The former was so [9]severe, that he [10]scourged and [11]beheaded
his own sons for [12]favouring [13]the banished kings, being a
[14]greater [15]friend to the [16]public [17]liberty than to his
own family. A [18]field of the Tarquins, which [19]lay [20]between
the city and [21]the Tiber, was [22]consecrated to [23]Mars, and
[24]from thence [25]called [26]Campus Martius. [27]Brutus [28]died
in the [29]war [30]against the Tarquins, who [31]prevailed upon some
of the [32]neighbouring [33]nations to [34]assist them; [35]amongst
the [36]rest, Porsena, king of Etruria, [37]made war upon the
Romans, in [38]favour of the Tarquins: in which war the [39]bravery
of [40]Horatius Coccles was very [41]remarkable, who [42]maintained
the [43]fight [44]against the [45]victorious [46]enemy [47]till the
[48]bridge on the Tiber was [49]cut down, [50]when he [51]swam and
crossed the [52]river. Nor [53]must we [54]pass over in silence
the [55]noble [56]attempt of [57]Mutius Scævola, who [58]secretly
[59]entered the [60]enemy’s [61]camp with a [62]resolution to [63]kill
the king; [64]but having by [65]mistake [66]slain one of his nobles, he
[67]thrust his [68]hand into the [69]fire that was upon the [70]altar;
which so [71]terrified the king, that he [72]made [73]peace with the
Romans, and [74]returned [75]home. [76]After this, the [77]Latins made
[78]war upon the Romans, [79]under the [80]conduct of [81]Octavius
Mamilius, Tarquin’s [82]son-in-law; [83]against whom [84]Posthumius
being made [85]dictator, [86]vanquished them in a [87]memorable
[88]battle at the [89]lake Regillus.

[90]Afterwards a war was [91]proclaimed [92]against the [93]Volsci, who
had [94]raised some [95]troops, to [96]send to the [97]assistance of
the [98]Latins in the [99]former war. The [100]fortune of [101]Caius
Marcius Coriolanus was [102]remarkable in that war, who being
[103]condemned in his [104]absence, [105]retired amongst the Volsci,
and [106]advised them to [107]renew the war; for the [108]management
of which, being [109]chosen [110]general with [111]Tullius Accius,
after he had [112]routed the Romans in [113]several [114]engagements,
and [115]advanced up [116]to the very walls of the city, he was
[117]moved by the [118]prayers of his [119]mother, and he [120]raised
the [121]siege. After the [122]death of [123]Coriolanus, the Volsci
[124]continued the war, and [125]were [126]together with the [127]Æqui,
[128]and Hernici, [129]soundly [130]beaten by [131]Spurius Cassius,
who had been [132]thrice [133]consul. [134]He being elevated by
his [135]success, [136]aspired to the [137]throne, [138]but was
[139]prevented in his [140]design, and [141]thrown headlong from the
[142]Tarpeian rock.

In the year 261 from the [143]building of the city, the [144]common
people being very [145]much in [146]debt, and [147]provoked by the
[148]cruelty of their [149]creditors, [150]retired [151]beyond the
[152]Anien into the [153]sacred mount, but were [154]reconciled by
the [155]pacific [156]persuasions of [157]Menenius Agrippa; having
[158]first [159]obtained from the [160]fathers, that [161]officers
should be [162]appointed to [163]screen them from the [164]violence
of the [165]patricii, who were [166] called [167]tribunes of the
[168]people.

After this, the Romans had a war with the [169]Veientes, which the
[170]family of the [171]Fabii [172]undertook to [173]carry on by
themselves; and having [174]pitched their camp by the [175]river
[176]Cremera, were [177]trepanned by the [178]enemy, and [179]cut off
in one [180]day, to the [181]number of 306.

The war with the [182]Volsci [183]continued. They were [184]often
[185]vanquished, [186]especially by T. [187]Quintius Cincinnatus,
who took [188]Antium, the [189]metropolis of their [190]nation.
Cincinnatus being [191]afterwards [192]taken from the [193]plough, and
[194]made [195]dictator [196]against the [197]Æqui, he [198]delivered
the [199]consul [200]Minucius, who was [201]besieged by them, and
[202]obliged the [203]enemy to [204]pass under the [205]yoke.

In the year 303, [206]after the [207]foundation of the city, and 451
years [208]before [209]Christ, the [210]form of the [211]government
was [212]changed. [213]For [214]instead of [215]consuls, the
[216]decemviri were [217]set up, with [218]supreme [219]power to
[220]make [221]laws for the Roman [222]people, [223]from those which
their ambassadors had the year before [224]brought from [225]Greece.
But [226]abusing their [227]power, they were [228]obliged to [229]lay
down their [230]authority; and the [231]consuls and [232]tribunes were
[233]restored.

In the 315th year of the city, Sp. Melius, in the [234]time of a
[235]famine, [236]endeavouring to [237]make his way to a [238]throne,
by [239]sharing [240]corn [241]amongst the [242]people, was [243]slain
by [244]order of [245]Quintius Cincinnatus the [246]dictator, by
[247]C. Servilius Ahala [248]master of the horse. In the [249]following
year the [250]Fidenates [251]revolted to [252]Lars Tolumnius, king of
the [253]Veientes, and [254]put the Roman ambassadors to [255]death,
who had their [256]statues [257]erected in the [258]forum. The
[259]Veientes [260]in the next year were [261]subdued by [262]Mamercus
Æmilius, [263]dictator. [264]Tolumnius was [265]slain by [266]Cornelius
Cossus, who was the [267]second from [268]Romulus that [269]dedicated
the [270]spoils [271]called [272]Opima to Jupiter [273]Feretrius.

[274]Censors were [275]set up at Rome in the 311th year of the city,
who [276]held their [277]office [278]at first for [279]five [280]years,
[281]but were [282]afterwards, in the year 320, [283]reduced by
[284]Mamercus Æmilius, [285]dictator, to a year and a [286]half. In the
year 323, the [287]dictator [288]A. Posthumius was very [289]successful
[290]against the [291]Æqui and the [292]Volsci; but [293]stained
the [294]victory with the [295]blood of his own [296]son, whom he
[297]beheaded for having [298]fought [299]contrary to his [300]orders.

In the year of the city 358, the [301]town of [302]Veii was [303]taken
by [304]Camillus, dictator, [305]after a [306]siege of [307]ten years.
He [308]likewise [309]reduced the [310]Falisci, [311]not so much by his
[312]arms, as the [313]opinion they had of his [314]justice.

But after these [315]great [316]successes, the Romans were [317]nearly
[318]ruined by the [319]Galli Senones, who having [320]laid [321]siege
to [322]Clusium in Etruria, the Romans [323]sent three of the
[324]Fabian family ambassadors to them. These, [325]contrary to the
[326]law of [327]nations, [328]marched out into the [329]field with the
[330]Clusini against the [331]Gauls, which proceeding so [332]incensed
the latter, that [333]leaving [334]Clusium, they marched to Rome.
The Romans were [335]routed, and [336]put to [337]flight in the very
[338]first [339]attack at Allia. After which the city was [340]taken
and [341]burnt; the [342]Capitol, [343]whither the [344]flower of
the Roman [345]youth [346]retreated, was [347]besieged, and had it
not been for Manlius, who was afterwards surnamed [348]Capitolinus,
would have been [349]taken by the [350]barbarians in the [351]night
time; but he, being [352]awakened by the [353]cackling of [354]geese,
and [355]others [356]with him, [357]pushed the [358]Gauls [359]as
they [360]came up, [361]headlong down the precipice. [362]In the mean
time [363]Camillus, who was [364]then in [365]exile at Ardea, being
[366]recalled and [367]made [368]dictator, [369]raised an [370]army,
[371]came to Rome, [372]drove them out, and at [373]about [374]eight
[375]miles [376]distance from the city [377]utterly [378]destroyed
their [379]whole [380]army.

CHAP. IV.

_(Of the World, 3670--Of Rome, 370.)_


The city being [1]destroyed by the Gauls, the Romans had [2]thoughts
of [3]leaving it, and [4]removing to [5]Veii; but were [6]dissuaded
from that [7]design by [8]Camillus; [9]whilst [10]Marcus Manlius (who
[11]obtained the [12]surname of [13]Capitolinus for his [14]noble
[15]defence of the [16]Capitol) [17]endeavoured by [18]ambition and
[19]popular [20]favour [21]to possess himself of the [22]supreme
[23]power, he was [24]thrown from the [25]Tarpeian rock, which he had
[26]defended, in the year 370.

In the year 377, there was a [27]strong [28]contest [29]between the
[30]nobility and the [31]people. [32]C. Licinius Stolo and [33]L.
Sextius, [34]tribunes of [35]the people, [36]proposed a [37]law
for [38]choosing [39]one of the consuls out [40]of the people.
They [41]carried their point at last, in the year 387, and in the
[42]following year [43]L. Sextius was elected consul.

[44]After this, the Romans had [45]war with the [46]Tiburtes, the
[47]Tarquinenses, and [48]Falisci; and again with the [49]Gauls, who
being [50]drawn up [51]in order of [52]battle, one of them [53]sent a
[54]challenge to the Romans, and was [55]slain by [56]one M. Valerius,
a [57]tribune of the [58]soldiers, by the [59]assistance of a [60]crow,
who [61]from thence had the [62]surname of [63]Corvinus.

[64]But of all their [65]wars, none was more [66]troublesome and
[67]lasting than that [68]against the [69]Samnites; which the Romans
[70]undertook the year of the city 411, at the [71]request of the
[72]Campani. It [73]lasted [74]seventy years; [75]though they were
[76]several times [77]beaten, as in the year 413, in which the
[78]Latins [79]rose up in arms [80]against the Romans, but were the
year after [81]conquered by the [82]consuls Torquatus and Decius;
the [83]former of whom [84]beheaded his own [85]son for [86]fighting
[87]without his [88]order; the [89]other [90]devoted himself to
[91]destruction for the [92]army; after which the [93]enemies
[94]submitted, but [95]soon after [96]rebelling again, they were [97]at
last [98]entirely [99]reduced in the year 416.

[100]About this time the [101]Gauls [102]made a [103]peace with the
Romans, which they [104]kept [105]thirty years. But in 450, the
[106]Cisalpine, [107]together with the [108]Transalpine [109]Gauls,
and the [110]Tuscans, [111]laid waste the [112]Roman [113]territories.
The Cisalpine [114]returning [115]home [116]loaded with [117]spoils,
[118]fell out together about them. [119]Four years after that, having
[120]joined the [121]Samnites and [122]Tuscans, they fell [123]upon the
Roman [124]army [125]commanded by [126]L. Scipio, the [127]proprætor,
in which [128]battle, [129]P. Decius [130]the consul [131]devoted
himself.

[132]Ten years after this, the [133]Galli Senones being [134]invited
by the [135]Lucani, [136]Brutii, Samnites, and Tuscans, [137]besieged
[138]Aretium, and having [139]vanquished [140]L. Cæcilius the
[141]prætor, [142]killed 13,000 Romans; which [143]overthrow the
consul Dolobella [144]revenged upon them [145]soon after; for having
[146]routed the [147]Gauls, and [148]taken their city of Sena,
[149]he sent a [150]colony there. The [151]Boii being [152]moved at
the [153]hard [154]fate of the [155]Senones, [156]entered into an
[157]alliance with the [158]Tuscans, and [159]engaged the Romans
at the [160]lake of [161]Vadimon; in which [162]battle [163]almost
[164]all the Tuscans were [165]slain, and very [166]few of the Boii
[167]escaped. This [168]happened in the year of the city 471; but in
the [169]following year the Boii were [170]entirely [171]reduced, which
was [172]about three years [173]before [174]Pyrrhus, [175]came into
[176]Italy.

The [177]Palæpolitani [178]likewise, [179]where [180]now [181]Naples
is, [182]venturing to make war upon the Romans, were [183]subdued the
third year [184]after, [185]that is to say, in the year of the city
428, by [186]Publius the proconsul.

The [187]twelve [188]nations of the Tuscans, [189]rising for the
[190]utter ruin [191]of the Roman name in the year of the city 442,
were [192]routed in a great [193]battle by Fabius the [194]consul,
in the [195]year 444, in which were [196]slain, or [197]taken of the
[198]enemy, to the [199]number of 60,000.

In the year 472, the [200]Tarentines, [201]brought the [202]Romans
against them [203]by plundering their [204]fleet, and [205]assailing
their [206]ambassadors, who [207]came to [208]complain of the
[209]injury. They, [210]together with the [211]Samnites, and
[212]Salentines, were [213]defeated by L. [214]Æmilius Barbula.
[215]Terrified at this [216]ill fortune, they [217]sent for
[218]Pyrrhus to their [219]assistance; who, in the year of the
city 474, having [220]brought over an [221]army into [222]Italy,
[223]waged against the Romans [224]a war which [225]lasted six
years. In the [226]first [227]encounter the Romans, [228]headed by
[229]Lævinus, being [230]conquered, not so much by the [231]strength
of the [232]enemy, as by the [233]strange [234]shape of the
[235]elephants, [236]yielded up the [237]day: Pyrrhus [238]dismissed
all the [239]prisoners [240]without [241]ransom. [242]Soon after,
having [243]made some [244]fruitless [245]overtures of [246]peace
by his [247]ambassador [248]Cyneas ([249]for [250]Appius Claudius
[251]obstructed it), he [252]engaged the Romans [253]twice: the
[254]victory [255]both times being [256]dubious. He was [257]then
[258]invited by the [259]Syracusans [260]into Sicily against
[261]the Carthaginians; [262]where [263]matters [264]not succeeding
[265]according to his [266]desires, he [267]returned into [268]Italy
in the year 479; and being [269]defeated, [270]forced out of his
[271]camp, and [272]beaten from [273]Tarentum, he returned into
[274]Epirus.

_(Of the World, 3790--Of Rome, 490.)_


[1]After this, a [2]war [3]broke out [4]between the Romans and the
[5]Carthaginians, in the year of the city 490, [6]occasioned by the
[7]ambition and [8]formidable [9]power of each of them. [10]Hiero,
king of Syracuse, and [11]ally of the Carthaginians, [12]made war
against the [13]Mamertini, who had [14]seized upon Messana. They
[15]applied to the Romans for [16]help, who [17]carrying over an
[18]army into [19]Sicily, [20]fell upon Hiero, and the Carthaginians.
The [21]fortune of the war was for a [22]long time very [23]doubtful;
the Carthaginians [24]being successful by [25]sea, and the Romans
by [26]land. The most [27]memorable [28]person in all this war was
[29]Attilius Regulus, who having [30]brought the Carthaginians [31]very
low by two [32]victories [33]obtained over them at sea and land; and
[34]refusing to [35]grant them [36]peace but upon [37]hard terms, he
was [38]vanquished by [39]Xantippus the [40]Lacedæmonian [41]general,
and [42]taken [43]prisoner with 15,000 [44]men, 30,000 being
[45]slain, in the year 498. Being [46]afterwards [47]sent to [48]Rome
by the [49]Carthaginians, to [50]treat with the [51]senate upon an
[52]exchange of [53]prisoners, he [54]interposed to [55]prevent it, and
[56]returning to [57]Carthage, was [58]put to [59]death in the most
[60]cruel [61]manner [62]imaginable, as [63]many [64]authors [65]tell
us. The [66]first among the Romans that [67]obtained a [68]victory
by sea, was C. [69]Duilius, in the first year of this [70]war. C.
[71]Lutatius [72]gained [73]another in the 23rd and [74]last year; in
which he [75]made an end of the war with the Carthaginians, [76]near
the [77]island of the [78]Ægates. A [79]peace was [80]concluded upon
these [81]terms, that they should [82]quit all the islands which
[83]lie between Italy and Africa, and should [84]pay [85]yearly 2,200
[86]talents for [87]twenty years [88]together. This [89]happened in the
year of the city 513, and 241 before [90]Christ.

In the year 519, the [91]temple of [92]Janus was [93]shut, which very
rarely [94]happened in Rome; but upon the [95]breaking out of new
wars, it was [96]soon [97]open again. The [98]Ligures, the Sardi, and
Corsi were [99]subdued; after which the Romans [100]had war with the
[101]Illyrians, and their [102]queen Teuta, which war was [103]ended in
[104]three years time. There [105]happened [106]about this [107]time a
[108]dreadful [109]irruption of the [110]Gauls. The [111]Insubres and
[112]Boii, having [113]first [114]sent for some [115]transalpine Gauls,
[116]fell upon the Romans, [117]on account of the [118]land in Picene,
that had been [119]taken from the Galli [120]Senones, and [121]disposed
of by [122]Flaminius, [123]tribune of the [124]people, by virtue of
the [125]Agrarian law, [126]made in the year of the city 452. They
were [127]several times [128]worsted, and the Insubres [129]entirely
[130]subdued, and king [131]Virdumarus [132]slain by C. [133]Marcellus,
the [134]consul, who was the only person after [135]Romulus that
[136]consecrated [137]Opima Spolia to [138]Jupiter Feretrius. In this
war Hiero, king of Sicily, [139]sent the Romans a [140]vast quantity of
[141]corn, the [142]price of which he [143]received after the war was
[144]ended.

After this, [145]followed a [146]second war with the Carthaginians,
four and twenty years after the [147]end of the [148]former; which
[149]indeed did not [150]last [151]so long, but was [152]so much
more [153]terrible for the [154]dreadful [155]slaughter that was
made in it ([156]says Florus) that if [157]any one [158]compared
the [159]losses on [160]each side, the [161]people that [162]proved
[163]victorious [164]seemed more [165]likely to be [166]conquered. The
first cause of this war was the [167]same with that of the former,
[168]ambition and the [169]impatience of the Carthaginians [170]under
their [171]servitude. The first cause of this [172]combustion was
[173]Hannibal, the son of [174]Hamilcar, who was [175]general of the
[176]Carthaginians in the [177]former [178]war, and had [179]accepted
the [180]conditions of peace [181]with a heavy heart. For after
[182]affairs were [183]settled in Africa, being [184]sent into
[185]Spain, in the year of the city 517, he [186]carried along with
him Hannibal, who [187]was then nine years old, having [188]first
[189]brought him before an [190]altar, and [191]made him [192]swear
that he [193]never would be a [194]friend to the Romans. Hamilcar
being [195]slain about nine years after, Asdrubal, his son-in-law,
was [196]put in his [197]place. He [198]sent for Hannibal, and
being slain himself eight years after, was [199]succeeded by him,
[200]being in the 27th year of his age. [201]As soon as he was made
[202]general, he [203]conquered all Spain within the river [204]Iberus.
After that he [205]fell upon the [206]town of [207]Saguntum with
all his [208]forces, and [209]took it, after a [210]siege of seven
[211]months. The [212]Saguntines having [213]in vain [214]waited for
[215]assistance from the Romans, [216]were all destroyed [217]partly by
the [218]enemy’s [219]sword, and [220]partly by their own [221]hands.
This war [222]broke out in the year of the city 536; and [223]lasted
seventeen years.

Upon the first [224]coming of Hannibal into Italy, both the
[225]consuls were [226]defeated, P. [227]Cornelius at [228]Ticinum, and
[229]Sempronius at Trebia. They [230]received a greater [231]overthrow
the [232]following year near the [233]Thrasymene [234]lake. [235]In
the mean time, Q. [236]Fabius Maximus being made [237]dictator by
the [238]people, [239]recovered in some [240]measure the Roman
[241]affairs. But the most [242]fatal [243]stroke was that of Cannæ, in
the year of the city 538, [244]occasioned by the [245]rashness of one
of the [246]consuls, [247]Terentius Varro. [248]Forty thousand Romans
were [249]killed in that [250]battle: [251]however, their [252]courage
was not [253]cast down by this [254]overthrow; [255]for they would
not [256]redeem those that had been [257]taken [258]prisoners, in
the battle of Cannæ. In the year 540, the [259]consul [260]Marcellus
[261]besieged [262]Syracuse, which had [263]declared for the
Carthaginians; it was [264]wonderfully [265]defended a long time by
the [266]contrivance of [267]Archimedes, who was an [268]excellent
[269]astronomer, but more [270]famous for the [271]invention of
[272]military [273]engines. It was [274]taken [275]at last with
[276]much [277]difficulty, after a [278]siege of three years. We are
[279]told that Archimedes being very [280]intent upon his [281]study
at that time, and not [282]minding the [283]hurry, and [284]noise of
the [285]army, when they [286]broke into the [287]town, was [288]killed
by a [289]soldier; that Marcellus was much [290]concerned for his
[291]death, having [292]given [293]strict [294]charge to his [295]men
to [296]spare his [297]life.

[298]In the mean time, [299]Lævinus the [300]prætor [301]stopt
[302]Philip king of [303]Macedon, who having made an [304]alliance
with Hannibal, was [305]ready to [306]come into Italy, and [307]forced
him to [308]burn his [309]fleet, and [310]retreat into Macedon,
in the year of the city 542. But in Spain, the two [311]brothers
P. and C. [312]Scipio, who had [313]till then [314]prevented
Hasdrubal’s [315]passage into Italy to his brother Hannibal, and had
[316]performed a great many [317]gallant actions, were both slain,
and their [318]armies [319]destroyed. L. Marcus, a Roman knight,
being [320]chosen general, by the [321]votes of the [322]soldiers,
[323]upheld their [324]tottering [325]cause; by whose [326]conduct
in one [327]day, and a [328]night, two [329]camps of the [330]enemy
were [331]taken by [332]assault, and about [333]thirty-seven thousand
[334]men [335]slain. The [336]same year [337]Tarentum, [338]except
the [339]citadel, was taken by Hannibal; and Capua [340]besieged
by the Romans; and Hannibal [341]marched to Rome to [342]draw them
from it. But a [343]sudden [344]storm [345]arising, [346]forced
him from the [347]walls, and the [348]sight of it. Capua was after
that [349]surrendered to the Romans, the [350]grandees of which
[351]poisoned themselves; the [352]senators were [353]beheaded, and the
city [354]deprived of its [355]liberty.

There was a [356]son of that P. Scipio, who, as we have said was
[357]killed in [358]Spain, [359]named [360]likewise P. Scipio, who
after the [361]death of his [362]father and [363]uncle, was [364]sent
into Spain, [365]being but twenty-four years old. There having
[366]performed very great [367]things, and [368]vanquished Hasdrubal,
the son of [369]Gisco and [370]Mago, [371]he drove the Carthaginians
out of Spain, in five years after he [372]came there; from thence
[373]passing over into Africa, he [374]made an [375]alliance with
[376]Syphax, king of the [377]Masylians, and after that with Masanissa,
king of the [378]Masasulians. These things [379]were done in the
year 548, and the [380]third from the [381]death of [382]Marcellus;
who having been [383]successful in [384]several [385]battles with
Hannibal, was [386]at last, [387]trepanned by an [388]ambuscade, and
slain. In the [389]following year, Hasdrubal was [390]cut off, with his
[391]army [392]before he could [393]join his [394]brother, by the two
[395]consuls, [396]Claudius Nero and [397]Livius Salinator. Hannibal
was [398]then in Apulia, [399]opposed by Nero the consul. [400]Livy
was [401]encamped in [402]Cisalpine Gaul [403]against Hasdrubal, Nero
[404]marched [405]through Italy [406]privately, in six [407]days time,
[408]came to the [409]camp of his [410]colleague with a [411]part of
his [412]army, and having [413]conquered the [414]enemy, [415]returned
to his camp before Hannibal [416]perceived that he was [417]gone.
There are [418]said to have been 56,000 of the [419]enemy [420]slain
in the [421]battle, and 5,400 [422]taken [423]prisoners. The head
[424]of Hasdrubal was [425]thrown before the [426]advanced guard of the
Carthaginians by Nero.

P. Scipio [427]resolved to [428]carry the [429]war into Africa, that
he might [430]draw Hannibal out of Italy; but [431]at first that being
[432]looked upon as a [433]rash [434]design, he had neither [435]money
nor [436]men from the [437]government. [438]Wherefore, having
[439]raised none but [440]volunteers, and [441]borrowed money, he first
[442]went to [443]Sicily, and [444]from thence to Africa, in the year
550; [445]when the [446]image of the [447]Idæan mother was [448]brought
from [449]Pessinus in [450]Phrygia, to Rome, [451]according to the
[452]advice of [453]the oracle.

The general [454]employed [455]against him by the [456]Carthaginians
was Hasdrubal, the son of Gisco, who had [457]contracted his daughter
[458]Sophonisba to Masanissa. But the Carthaginians had [459]given
her to [460]Syphax, (who being [461]in love with the [462]young
lady, [463]laid waste their [464]country in the [465]absence of her
[466]father and [467]husband) to [468]take him off from the Roman
[469]alliance: at which [470]usage Masanissa being [471]incensed, he
[472]gave himself up [473]entirely to the Roman [474]interest, and was
very [475]serviceable to them in [476]reducing the Carthaginians.

[477]After a great many [478]overthrows, the Carthaginians [479]found
themselves [480]obliged to [481]recall Hannibal out of Italy, to
the [482]defence of their country, where, after a [483]fruitless
[484]overture of [485]peace, he was [486]vanquished by Scipio, and an
[487]end was put to the [488]war, after it had [489]lasted seven years.

The second [490]Punic war was [491]followed by the [492]Macedonian,
[493]against king Philip. That which put the Romans upon it was the
[494]former injuries [495]Philip had done them, [496]as likewise the
late [497]vexation he had given their [498]allies, [499]especially
the Athenians, who being [500]harassed by the king, [501]fled to the
Romans. [502]At length [503]Titus Quinctius Flaminius [504]put an end
to the war, four years after it [505]began, by the [506]conquest of
Philip at [507]Cynoscephalæ, in [508]Thessaly.

After this [509]followed the war with [510]Antiochus, king of Asia, who
having [511]recovered Syria, and [512]conquered Scopas, the general
of [513]Ptolemæus Epiphanes, [514]began now to be [515]formidable to
the Romans, [516]against whom Hannibal did not a little [517]inflame
him; who, for [518]fear of the same [519]enemy, had [520]fled to
the king. The [521]ambassadors of the [522]Ætolians too, who were
now [523]averse to the Roman [524]alliance, [525]contributed not a
[526]little towards it. Antiochus [527]therefore having [528]clapped up
a peace with [529]Ptolemy, to whom he [530]gave his daughter Cleopatra
in [531]marriage, and [532]granted [533]Cœlo Syria, and [534]Judea by
way of [535]portion, [536]made war upon the Romans, which being begun
in the year of the city 562, [537]lasted three years in all. For in
the year 565, L. [538]Cornelius Scipio the [539]consul, [540]going
over into Asia, with his brother P. Scipio [541]Africanus, as his
[542]lieutenant, did, by the [543]assistance, [544]chiefly of his
[545]counsel, [546]conquer Antiochus. Livy [547]tells us, there were
50,000 [548]foot [549]slain in one [550]battle, and 4,000 [551]horse.
A peace was [552]granted Antiochus [553]upon the following condition
[554]among others, that he should [555]recede [556]from all the
countries [557]on this side [558]mount Taurus.

After Antiochus was [559]conquered, the Ætolians were [560]reduced by
Fulvius the consul; and the same year the Gallo-Greci were [561]subdued
by the other [562]consul, Cneius Manlius.

In the 149th [563]Olympiad [564]died three [565]famous generals, P.
Scipio, Hannibal, and [566]Philopæmen. Scipio was [567]impeached for
[568]taking [569]money of Antiochus for the peace [570]he granted
him; after which he [571]retired to [572]Liturnum in Campania, and
[573]died there in the year of the city 570. Hannibal a year or two
after (for [574]historians are not [575]agreed upon the [576]matter)
being [577]demanded of Drusias, king of Bythynia, by the Roman
[578]ambassadors, [579]in order to be [580]put to [581]death,
[582]poisoned himself. [583]About the [584]same time Philopæmen,
general of the [585]Achæans, was [586]taken by the [587]Messenians,
and [588]slain, after he had [589]forced to a [590]submission the
Lacedæmonians, who had [591]thrown off the Achæan [592]alliance.

In the mean time Philip, being [593]checked [594]rather than
[595]conquered in the [596]former war, was [597]very busy in
[598]making [599]preparations for [600]another; but before [601]matters
were [602]ripe [603]enough [604]for that purpose, he died, and
was [605]succeeded by his son [606]Perseus, who [607]went on with
the [608]preparations of war [609]against the Romans; which was
[610]finished in four years after its [611]beginning with the [612]ruin
of him and the [613]kingdom of Macedon [614]together, in the year of
the city 586. The general [615]employed by the Romans in that war, was
[616]Paulus Æmilius, who in one [617]battle, [618]wherein were slain
20,000 [619]men, and 11,000 [620]taken [621]prisoners, [622]put a
[623]final period to the [624]Macedonian [625]empire in the [626]11th
year of king Perseus. About the same time, [627]Gentius, king of the
[628]Illyrians, being [629]trepanned into an [630]alliance by Perseus,
was [631]conquered by [632]Amicius the [633]prætor.

After the [634]conquest of Antiochus, the Macedonians [635]rebelled
again, but were [636]subdued, and Macedon [637]reduced to the [638]rank
of a [639]province.

Some time after a war [640]broke out with the [641]Achæans, who having
[642]pulled down all the [643]walls of [644]Lacedæmon, and [645]taken
away their [646]ancient [647]laws, had [648]obliged them to [649]unite
with them; which the Lacedæmonians [650]complained of to the Romans,
who [651]sent [652]against the Achæans Metellus the prætor, by whom
they were [653]defeated in two [654]engagements at [655]Thermopylæ, and
in [656]Phocis; and [657]presently after [658]entirely reduced by the
consul [659]L. Nummius, and [660]Corinth, the [661]metropolis of their
[662]nation, [663]burnt.

The same year Carthage was [664]taken and [665]destroyed. The
[666]occasion of this war was a [667]difference [668]between Masanissa
and the Carthaginians [669]about their [670]territories; which
[671]controversy being [672]referred to the Romans, they obliged the
Carthaginians to [673]give up the [674]country in [675]dispute, and
[676]money, also, to Masanissa. But the Romans had [677]before-hand
[678]resolved [679]utterly to [680]raze Carthage, [681]right or wrong,
[682]chiefly at the [683]instigation of [684]Marcus Cato the censor,
who, whenever he [685]gave his [686]opinion upon any [687]debate in the
[688]senate, [689]used [690]finally to [691]add, Carthage [692]must be
[693]destroyed. [694]Wherefore in the year of the city 605, Carthage
was [695]besieged by the consuls [696]Manilius and [697]Censorinus.
They soon after [698]surrendered to the Romans; but being [699]ordered
to [700]demolish their city, and [701]fix themselves at ten [702]miles
[703]distance from the [704]sea, they were so [705]inflamed with
[706]fury and [707]despair, that they [708]held out even [709]beyond
their [710]strength, [711]till in the fourth year, the [712]same
in which [713]Corinth was destroyed, it was [714]taken by [715]P.
Cornelius Scipio, the [716]proconsul, who was [717]Paulus Æmilius’s
son, and had been [718]adopted by the son of Scipio Africanus. At
the [719]beginning of the war Masanissa, king of the [720]Numidians,
[721]died, in the 97th year of his [722]age, having [723]left behind
him forty-four sons, and [724]continued [725]an ally of the Romans near
60 years.

(_Of the World, 3908--Of Rome, 608._)


[1]About the same time the [2]Lusitanians in [3]Spain [4]beat the
Romans most [5]shamefully [6]under the [7]conduct of [8]Viriathus; who
from a [9]huntsman [10]became a [11]highwayman; and from a highwayman,
a general, and [12]defeated the Roman [13]armies [14]several times. But
that [15]overthrow was most [16]memorable of all [17]others, in which,
in the year 608, having [18]routed the [19]forces of [20]Vetilius
the [21]prætor, [22]he took him prisoner, and [23]put him [24]to
death, according to [25]Appian. Nor was he the [26]only one that was
[27]conquered by Viriathus, but several others [28]underwent the
same [29]fate. The first that was [30]successful [31]against him was
[32]C. Lælius the prætor, in the year 609. After which the proconsul
[33]Quintius Fabius Maximus [34]defeated him. In the year 614, [35]Q.
Servilius Cæpio [36]basely [37]procured him to be [38]assassinated
by some of his own [39]officers, whom he had [40]bribed [41]for that
purpose, to the great [42]dishonour of the Roman [43]name.

After this a much more [44]dangerous war [45]broke out in Celtiberia.
The Numantini having [46]received the [47]Segidenses their [48]allies,
that had [49]escaped the [50]hands of the Romans, were [51]commanded
by Metellus the proconsul, [52]to deliver up the [53]refugees, and
[54]lay down their [55]arms, but they [56]refused both: and [57]though
they were so much [58]inferior to the Romans, in [59]number and
[60]strength, they [61]made a [62]gallant [63]resistance for some
[64]years. The [65]army of [66]M. Popilius the proconsul, was [67]cut
off by them, and the year [68]following, [69]thirty [70]thousand
Romans, under the consul Mancinus, were [71]routed by four thousand
of the Numantini; which [72]disgrace was [73]followed by a most
[74]shameful [75]peace; but the senate [76]refused to [77]ratify
it; [78]wherefore Mancinus was [79]delivered up into their hands,
but the Numantini would not [80]receive him. [81]At last they were
[82]vanquished in the [83]field by Scipio, who had [84]destroyed
Carthage; and being [85]shut up within their own [86]walls, were
[87]reduced to [88]so desperate a condition, that they all [89]laid
violent hands upon themselves; and Numantia was [90]levelled with the
ground, in the ninth year after their [91]revolt from the Romans, and
from the [92]foundation of the city 621.

[93]Whilst the Romans were [94]still at war with the [95]Achæans and
Carthaginians, Macedon was [96]conquered a third time. [97]Andriscus,
a [98]man of [99]mean birth, who [100]pretended to be [101]Philip the
son of [102]Perseus, had [103]possessed himself of it. He was conquered
by [104]Q. Cæcilius Metellus, with the [105]slaughter of 25,000
[106]of his men. Metellus had [107]from thence [108]the surname of
[109]Macedonicus.

At the time that the Romans were [110]engaged in the [111]Numantine
war, there was a [112]rising of the [113]slaves in Sicily. A
[114]Syrian, [115]by name Eunus, [116]pretending to a [117]divine
[118]inspiration, [119]called the slaves to [120]arms and [121]liberty,
[122]as it were by the [123]order of the [124]gods; and having
[125]raised a [126]vast [127]army, [128]consisting of no less than
70,000 men, he [129]vanquished four Roman prætors, and was [130]at last
[131]routed himself, by P. Rupilius the consul, in the year of the city
622.

Attalus, son of [132]Eumenes, king of [133]Phrygia, when his [134]uncle
Attalus was [135]dead (who after Eumenes’ death had [136]managed the
[137]kingdom as his [138]guardian), [139]reigned five years, and dying
about the year of the city 621, made the Roman people his [140]heir:
which [141]Aristonicus, a son of Eumenes by one of his [142]mistresses,
[143]taking amiss, he [144]seized upon Asia, and [145]cut off the army
of Crassus the prætor. Afterwards he was [146]vanquished by the consul
Peperna, and an [147]end was put to the war the year [148]following,
625, by M. Aquilius the consul. This was a [149]melancholy year for
the [150]death of Scipio Africanus, who was [151]found dead in his
[152]bed, not without the [153]suspicion of having been [154]poisoned
by his [155]wife.

The year in which Attalus [156]made the Roman people his [157]heir,
there was a [158]formidable [159]sedition at Rome. For T. Gracchus,
[160]tribune of the [161]people, having made the [162]Agrarian
law, that [163]nobody should [164]possess above 500 [165]acres of
[166]land, and [167]proposing to have the [168]money of king Attalus
[169]divided amongst the people, and [170]likewise [171]suing for the
[172]tribuneship against the year following, the senators being very
much [173]disturbed at the [174]matter, he was, by the [175]order of
P. Corn. Nasica, [176]slain in the [177]Capitol, [178]whither he had
[179]fled for [180]refuge.

After the death of Tiberius, his [181]brother Caius [182]pursuing
the same [183]design, was [184]taken off by Opimius, the consul, and
[185]together with him, Fulvius Flaccus, who had been consul.

In the year of the city 629, the Romans first made war upon the
[186]Gauls [187]beyond the Alps. They [188]began with the Salii,
and [189]Allobroges, whom Fulvius Flaccus [190]subdued. In the year
633, Fabius the consul made an end of the war with the Allobroges.
He [191]conquered Bituitus, king of the Arverni, in [192]battle.
The king himself [193]coming to Rome to [194]satisfy the senate,
was [195]confined at Alba. Then Gallia Narbonensis was made a
[196]province, and a [197]colony [198]sent to Narbon in the year 636.

The Romans were after this [199]almost [200]perpetually at war with
the Gauls, by whom they were [201]oftentimes [202]soundly beaten; but,
above all others, the Cimbri and Teutones were [203]terrible to them.
They [204]marching for Italy, and not [205]being able to [206]prevail
with the senate for [207]room to [208]settle in, they [209]routed M.
Silanus the consul; the year following Scaurus was [210]defeated by the
Cimbri, and L. Cassius by the Helvetii Tigurini the year after that.
But the [211]overthrow of Q. Cæpio was more [212]memorable than all the
[213]rest. He had [214]plundered [215]Tholouse in the [216]country of
the Tectosagæ, and had [217]carried off an hundred thousand [218]pounds
of [219]gold, and fifteen hundred thousand pounds of [220]silver. This
was done in the year of the city 648. But the following, he, with C.
Manilius, [221]paid for this [222]sacrilege, with the [223]utter,
[224]destruction of the Roman army. It is certain there were [225]slain
in this [226]battle of the Romans and their [227]allies, [228]fourscore
thousand, and of [229]servants that [230]followed the [231]camp
[232]threescore thousand.

At length the Teutones and the [233]Ambrones were almost all
[234]destroyed, two hundred thousand being slain, and seventy thousand
[235]taken [236]prisoners, by C. Marius the consul, in the year 652;
and the following year, the same Marius, [237]in conjunction with
Catulus, defeated the Cimbri, that were [238]making their way through
[239]Noricum, [240]slew an hundred and twenty thousand, and took sixty
thousand prisoners.

With so many [241]victories did Marius [242]consummate the [243]glory
he had [244]got in the war with Jugurtha. For in the year of the city
643, a war was [245]undertaken against Jugurtha, king of Numidia,
because he had [246]deprived his [247]cousins Hiempsal and Adherbal,
the sons of Micipsa, and [248]grandsons of Masanissa, of their
[249]lives and [250]kingdom. He [251]prevailed against the Romans
for some years, more by his gold than by his arms; but was at last
[252]brought low by Metellus the consul, and [253]finally [254]entirely
[255]subdued by Marius, and [256]delivered up by Bocchus, king of
Mauritania, to whom he had [257]fled for refuge; after which he was
[258]carried to Rome, to [259]grace the [260]triumph of Marius, and
[261]put to death in [262]prison.

This [263]happy [264]progress of the [265]empire [266]abroad, was
[267]interrupted by [268]frequent and [269]shameful [270]disorders
at [271]home, which were [272]occasioned by the tribunes. Saturninus
having [273]had the Agrarian law [274]passed, to [275]divide among the
people the land which Marius had got, by [276]driving the Cimbri out of
Gaul, [277]banished Metellus Numidicus, who [278]opposed him; but at
last was [279]slain himself by Marius, then consul for the sixth time,
in the year 654; and the following year Metellus was [280]recalled from
[281]banishment.

After Saturninus, Livius Drusus, tribune of the people, but
[282]favouring the senate, being [283]desirous to [284]restore them to
their [285]ancient [286]splendor, and to [287]put the [288]execution of
their laws into their [289]hands, which C. Gracchus had [290]divided
[291]between them and the [292]knights, he passed the same Agrarian
laws, and put the [293]allies in [294]hopes of the [295]freedom of the
city; which [296]being not able to [297]bring about, he [298]fell under
an universal [299]odium, and was [300]stabbed, nobody [301]knew how, in
the year 663.

After this, the Romans were [302]engaged in two most [303]difficult and
terrible wars, almost at the same time; one in Italy, and the other
without. That was [304]called the [305]Social or [306]Marsic war,
because the Marsi had been the first [307]beginners of it; for all the
[308]Latins, and most of the people of Italy, being [309]disgusted,
that they who were [310]sharers in all the [311]hardships and
[312]dangers of the war, should be [313]excluded from the [314]honours
and [315]dignities of the [316]state; and being [317]frustrated in
the hopes of [318]obtaining the [319]freedom of the city by Drusus,
[320]endeavoured to [321]compass that by [322]force of arms, which
they could not obtain [323]by fair means. They first [324]attempted
in the Latin [325]Feriæ, to [326]assassinate both the consuls,
Philip and Cæsar; but the [327]matter being [328]discovered, they
[329]openly [330]revolted, [331]massacred Q. Servilius the proconsul,
[332]Fonteius and all the Romans at [333]Asculum. After this the war
was [334]carried on with [335]various [336]success. Cn. [337]Pompey
Strabo, father of Pompey the [338]Great, [339]distinguished himself
upon this [340]occasion. He [341]forced the Vestini and Peligni
to [342]submission, and [343]triumphed upon that [344]account.
[345]Likewise L. Sylla Cæsar, the consul’s [346]lieutenant, did, by his
great successes against the enemy, [347]obtain the [348]consulship, in
which he [349]made an end of the war.

Soon after [350]broke out a war between the Romans and
[351]Mithridates, who having [352]taken off Ariarthes, king of
Cappadocia, his [353]sister’s [354]husband, together with his son
of the same [355]name, had [356]seized upon the kingdom; but being
forced to [357]forego what he had [358]unjustly got, Ariobarzanes was
[359]nominated king of Cappadocia by the senate, but forced out of his
[360]dominions by Mithridates, and [361]restored by Sylla. After this
he was once more [362]driven out of Cappadocia by Mithridates, [363]as
was likewise Nicomedes out of Bithynia. But both [364]recovered their
dominions again by a [365]decree of the senate; which Mithridates being
[366]offended at, he [367]invaded Cappadocia and Bithynia, [368]routed
the Roman armies, [369]massacred all the Italians, [370]throughout
Asia in one day; and [371]reduced Macedon, [372]Thrace, [373]Greece,
and [374]Athens. The consul Sylla [375]marching against him, [376]took
Athens, and having [377]defeated his generals, forced him to a peace
upon the [378]conditions of his [379]quitting Asia, Bithynia, and
Cappadocia.

CHAP. VII.

_(Of the World, 3966--Of Rome, 666.)_


Marius, [1]though now [2]broken with [3]age and years, yet being very
[4]ambitious of getting [5]employed against Mithridates, could not
[6]bear with patience the [7]bestowing that [8]province upon Sylla.
[9]Wherefore he [10]prevailed by the [11]means of C. Sulpicius, the
tribune of the people, to have it [12]taken from Sylla, and bestowed
upon himself. At which Sylla being [13]enraged, [14]seized upon the
city, and having [15]slain Sulpicius, [16]obliged Marius to [17]fly.
In his [18]absence, Cinna the consul, making a [19]disturbance, was
[20]driven out of the city, and being [21]joined by Marius, Carbo, and
Sertorius, [22]assaulted Rome; which, having [23]taken, [24]he put a
great many of the Romans [25]to the sword. Marius [26]died a natural
death the year following.

Sylla having made peace with Mithridates, [27]returned into Italy, and
[28]made an end of the civil war in two years time, by the [29]defeat
of Carbo, Norbanus, young Marius, and others; and being [30]declared
[31]dictator, [32]took off a great many of Marius’s party by means of a
[33]proscription. Q. Sertorius [34]retired into Farther Spain, where he
[35]held out for some years very [36]valiantly.

Sylla having in the year 675 [37]laid down the [38]dictatorship,
died the year following of the [39]lousy [40]disease, in the
sixtieth year of his [41]age. After his death, Lepidus the consul,
[42]endeavouring to [43]annul the [44]acts of Sylla, was [45]forced
out of the city by his [46]colleague Catulus. And the year following
[47]advancing up to the city with an [48]army, he was defeated by the
same Catulus and Cn. Pompey, and [49]fled into [50]Sardinia, where
he [51]fell ill and died. The same Pompey being [52]sent into Spain
against Sertorius, [53]performed no important things; but the latter
being [54]treacherously [55]slain by his own people, he [56]easily
[57]recovered that province in the year 681.

In the mean time the war with Mithridates [58]broke out again, while
Sylla was yet living; and after Sylla’s death, Mithridates having
[59]entered into an [60]alliance with Sertorius, [61]seized by force of
arms upon Bithynia, which Nicomedes at his death in 679, had [62]left
to the Roman people. L. Lucullus consul, in 680, [63]went against
him, and being very [64]successful both by [65]sea and [66]land, he
[67]obliged him to fly, first into [68]Pontus, and soon after to
[69]Tigranes in Armenia. Lucullus [70]conquered Pontus, and defeated
both the kings who [71]engaged him with an army of two hundred thousand
[72]foot and sixty thousand [73]horse, in the year of the city 685.
After this, Tigranocerta, the capital of Armenia, and [74]Nisibis, two
very great cities, were [75]taken. But this excellent general being
[76]forsaken by his men, was [77]obliged to [78]leave the [79]fruit
of his [80]toil and [81]victories to Cn. Pompey, in the year 688.
He having [82]forced Tigranes to [83]surrender, obliged him to be
[84]satisfied with Armenia; and whilst he [85]pursued Mithridates,
he [86]added the [87]Iberians and [88]Albanians to the Roman empire,
in the year 689. [89]Finally, Mithridates, in the year 691, being
[90]every where [91]beaten, [92]thought of [93]flying into [94]Gaul,
but being [95]discouraged by the [96]revolt of his son [97]Pharnaces
and the army, he [98]slew himself.

Whilst the war with Mithridates was [99]warmly [100]carried on,
there [101]broke out another with the [102]slaves, in the year
of the city 681. One [103]Spartacus Ænomanus, and [104]Crixus,
[105]gladiators, having [106]broken up a [107]school of gladiators
at Capua, [108]belonging to Lentulus, and [109]assembled an army of
[110]desperadoes, [111]routed the Roman armies several times, but at
last were [112]vanquished by Crassus the prætor, and Pompey, in the
year 685.

Pompey [113]likewise [114]subdued the [115]pirates, who, at the
[116]instigation of Mithridates, [117]infested the seas, having
an [118]extraordinary [119]commission [120]for that purpose by
the [121]Gabinian law. Whilst Pompey was [122]enlarging the Roman
empire [123]abroad, the [124]head of the empire was in no small
[125]danger from a [126]conspiracy which [127]Cataline, [128]Lentulus
the prætor, [129]Cethegus, and other senators, had [130]entered
into, to [131]murder the consul [132]Cicero, and to [133]burn and
[134]plunder the city. But their [135]designs were [136]prevented by
the [137]vigilance of the consul. Catiline being [138]forced out of the
city, [139]repaired to the army, which some of his [140]accomplices
had [141]collected. Lentulus, and the rest of the [142]ringleaders of
the [143]plot were put to death. This [144]happened in the year 691,
and the following year Cataline was [145]defeated by [146]Petreius
[147]Antony the proconsul’s [148]lieutenant, and [149]slain in the
[150]fight.

The whole [151]world being now almost [152]subdued, the Roman empire
was [153]arrived to that [154]grandeur, that it could [155]hardly
[156]extend itself farther. No [157]outward [158]force was
[159]sufficient to [160]ruin it; it [161]fell by its own [162]power,
which was [163]occasioned by the [164]ambition of the [165]leading men,
and the civil [166]contests that [167]arose from thence.

C. Cæsar, after the time of his [168]prætorship in the city was
[169]expired, [170]obtained the province of Lusitania; and by the
great feats he [171]performed there, [172]deserved well the honor
of a [173]triumph; but [174]postponed the [175]hopes of that to
the [176]consular [177]dignity; for which, [178]while he made all
[179]possible [180]interest, Pompey [181]united with Cæsar and Crassus,
while Lucullus and some others of the [182]grandees, [183]opposing his
[184]acts, which he [185]desired might be [186]ratified by the senate.
Thus Cæsar [187]gained the [188]consulship in the year 695, in which
he [189]established the acts of Pompey by the senate, and [190]divided
the [191]public [192]lands in Campania amongst the [193]citizens. He
[194]married his daughter Julia to Pompey, and [195]took Calphurnia,
the daughter of [196]Piso [197]as a wife. Having by these [198]arts,
and a [199]boundless [200]generosity, [201]gained the [202]favor
of all [203]ranks and [204]degrees of men, he [205]procured the
province of Gaul, which he [206]governed for nine years; during
which time he [207]reduced all Gaul, that is [208]comprehended
within the [209]Pyrenean mountains, the [210]Alps, the Rhone, and
the [211]Rhine, in the [212]form of a province, and [213]imposed a
[214]yearly [215]tribute upon it. He was the first of all the Romans
that [216]attacked the [217]Germans [218]beyond the Rhine. He likewise
[219]visited the [220]Britons, where [221]none before him had ever
[222]come. In this [223]interval, in the year 698, he [224]entered into
an [225]association with Pompey and Crassus; by [226]virtue of which he
was to have Gaul [227]continued to him. Pompey was to have [228]Spain,
and Crassus Syria, in order to a war against the [229]Parthians; to
which he [230]accordingly [231]went in the year 699, and the third year
after, [232]perished most [233]miserably, with the greater [234]part of
his army; after which the Parthians made an [235]irruption into Syria,
but were [236]bravely [237]repulsed by Cassius.

After the death of Crassus, Pompey not being able to [238]endure
an [239]equal, nor Cæsar a [240]superior, the civil war broke out.
Pompey’s [241]party [242]endeavouring to [243]take away from Cæsar
both his army and province, as soon as the time of his [244]government
should [245]expire; whilst Cæsar’s on the other [246]hand were for
[247]treating Pompey [248]in like manner. At last in the year 705,
in the [249]consulship of C. Claudius Marcellus, and L. Cornelius
Lentulus, the senate, by a [250]vote, obliged Cæsar to [251]disband his
army by a certain day. Antonius and Cassius, tribunes of the people,
[252]interposing their [253]authority in vain, [254]left the town, and
[255]repaired to Cæsar, who [256]advancing his army towards the city,
[257]struck such a [258]consternation into Pompey and the rest, that
[259]leaving the city [260]without much ado, and [261]shortly after
Italy, they [262]passed over into [263]Greece. Cæsar went to Spain,
where he [264]vanquished Petreius and Afranius, and [265]forced their
armies to [266]surrender [267]prisoners of war. In his [268]return
he [269]took [270]Marseilles, and after that was made dictator, to
which [271]office he was [272]chosen four times, and at last had it
[273]given him for [274]life.

In the year 706, Pompey being [275]defeated by Cæsar in the
[276]fields of [277]Pharsalia, went to [278]Egypt, where he was
slain by the [279]order of [280]Ptolemy, in the 59th year of his
[281]age. Hither Cæsar [282]likewise [283]came the following year, and
after a very [284]dangerous [285]rencounter, which he [286]happily
[287]accomplished, [288]delivered the [289]kingdom of Egypt to
Cleopatra and her brother. In the year following he vanquished Scipio
and Cato, with king Juba, in Africa. Cato [290]laid violent hands upon
himself at Utica. The year that [291]followed was [292]remarkable
for the [293]correction of the [294]calendar and the year. The same
year likewise he [295]conquered Pompey’s sons; and the year after was
[296]stabbed in the [297]senate house, by a [298]conspiracy of Brutus
and Cassius, and some others, in the 56th year of his age.

Besides these [299]convulsions, with which the whole [300]world was
[301]shattered, there were some less [302]disturbances [303]happened
a little before. [304]Clodius Pulcher being [305]made tribune of
the people, [306]banished Cicero, for having [307]condemned the
[308]associates of Cataline to death without a [309]trial; which
[310]calamity he [311]bore too [312]meanly, and [313]by no means
[314]agreeable to the [315]dignity of his past life. But he was
[316]recalled the year after by the [317]interposition of Pompey, and
Lentulus the consul, and [318]received with the greatest [319]honor.
The same Clodius [320]declared [321]Cyprus to [322]belong to the
Roman people, and Cato being [323]sent to [324]take possession of
it, Ptolemy, king of the [325]island, after first [326]throwing all
his [327]money into the sea, [328]prevented his [329]disgrace by a
[330]voluntary death. The senate [331]bestowed the [332]prætorship
upon Cato at his [333]return, by a [334]vote of the house, without
any [335]election; which honor he [336]refused, being [337]desirous
to [338]obtain it rather by the [339]free [340]votes of the people.
But he was [341]disappointed in his [342]hopes, and Vatinius was
[343]preferred to him.

[344]Bribery [345]ruling in [346]all [347]elections, and the
[348]candidates making a most [349]dismal [350]confusion, after a long
[351]interregnum, Pompey was made consul, without a [352]colleague,
a thing [353]wholly new, and never heard of before; in which office
he made a [354]severe [355]inquiry into all other [356]misdemeanors,
as likewise into the death of Clodius, whom Milo [357]killed the same
year, and for which he was [358]banished.

After the death of Cæsar, Antony the consul so [359]inflamed the
people by [360]a seditious [361]harangue, that they [362]burnt his
[363]body [364]publicly, and [365]threatened to set fire, and [366]pull
down the houses of the [367]assassins. Octavius Cæsar, the son of
Accia [368]Julius’s sister, was his [369]adopted son by [370]will. He
being [371]slighted by M. Antony, [372]raised an army of [373]veteran
soldiers, and [374]opposed his [375]tyrannical [376]proceedings.
Antonius [377]extorted from the people by force the province of Gaul,
but his [378]passage there was opposed by D. Brutus at Modena, where he
was [379]besieged by Antony.

In the [380]consulship of [381]Hirtius and Pansa, in the year of the
city 711, at the [382]instigation of Cicero Antony was [383]declared
[384]enemy, and a war [385]undertaken against him; when Octavius
[386]joined in [387]commission with the consuls, with the [388]power
of proconsul, being then about the 20th year of his age. There was a
[389]dreadful and [390]bloody [391]battle [392]fought near Modena, in
which all Cæsar’s [393]life-guards were slain; but Antony was routed,
and the [394]siege [395]raised, yet both the consuls were killed.

In Macedon, Brutus [396]took off C. Antonius, M. Antony’s brother,
who was [397]intriguing against him, and [398]got together a
[399]formidable army. Upon which the senate [400]resolved by
[401]degrees to [402]take down Octavius, [403]for fear of his
[404]growing too [405]powerful; which he being [406]apprehensive of,
[407]he entered into an [408]association with Antony and Lepidus;
and [409]consequently they were all three made [410]commissioners
[411]for settling the [412]republic. They having [413]divided the whole
[414]empire into three parts, [415]proscribed a great many of the
Romans, and amongst the rest M. [416]Tully Cicero, who, whilst he was
[417]endeavouring to [418]make his escape into Greece, was killed by
Pompilius, a [419]captain, whose [420]cause he had [421]pleaded in a
capital [422]action. There was a [423]dreadful [424]havoc made in this
[425]proscription. The [426]Epitome of Livy speaks of no less than an
hundred and thirty senators; the same year, [427]gave [428]beginning to
one of the finest cities of France, [429]Lyons.

The year following, Octavius and Antony [430]fought a battle with M.
Brutus and the [431]principal of the [432]conspirators, near the city
of Philippi. The [433]right [434]wings were [435]victorious on both
[436]sides, and on both sides the [437]camps were [438]plundered.
But Cassius, who was in the wing that was [439]routed, [440]giving
up all for lost, [441]slew himself. Brutus, being [442]defeated in
another [443]engagement, likewise put an end to his own life, being
then thirty-seven years of age, and none of Cæsar’s [444]assassins
[445]lived above three years after, being all [446]taken off by a
[447]violent death, as [448]Suetonius says; some too [449]killed
themselves with the same [450]dagger with which they had slain Cæsar.

After the [451]victory, Antony [452]went to Asia, and Octavius to
Italy; where he [453]was engaged in a war with L. Antony, the brother
of the [454]triumvir, and his [455]wife Fulvia, a [456]woman of a
[457]manly [458]spirit. He forced Lucius from the town; after which,
being [459]declared an enemy, he [460]besieged him in Perusia, and
obliged him to [461]surrender. In the mean time, the Parthians being
[462]invited by Labienus, one of Pompey’s party, made an [463]irruption
into Syria, whom Ventidius, after a very [464]signal [465]overthrow,
in which the king was slain, [466]drove out again, and [467]recovered
Syria.

S. Pompey, Cneius’s son, having a [468]fleet at his [469]command,
[470]infested the seas. Cæsar made with him a peace, which was
[471]soon [472]broken. [473]An engagement [474]followed, wherein
Pompey was [475]worsted, and [476]forced to [477]fly. He was soon
after [478]put to death by [479]order of M. Antony, under whose
[480]protection he had put himself. About this time Antony made an
[481]attempt upon the Parthians, by whom he was most [482]shamefully
[483]beaten. At last Antony being [484]entirely [485]devoted to his
Cleopatra, [486]divorced Octavia, Cæsar’s sister, and [487]declared war
against him, in which he was at last defeated by sea near [488]Actium,
a [489]promontory of [490]Epirus. Cæsar had upwards of 400 [491]ships,
and Antony about 200, but so [492]prodigiously [493]large, that they
[494]looked like [495]castles and cities [496]moving through the
sea. The [497]flight of Cleopatra [498]turned the [499]fate of a
[500]dubious [501]engagement into the [502]ruin of Antony; he followed
her into Egypt, and being [503]besieged in Alexandria, he [504]slew
himself, and Cleopatra soon [505]followed his [506]example.

CHAP. VIII.

_(Of Rome, 725--Of Christ, 11.)_


After the death of Antony and Cleopatra, [1]Egypt was [2]reduced to the
[3]form of a [4]province. Cæsar, in the year 725, [5]triumphed three
times, for the [6]conquest of [7]Dalmatia, the victory at Actium, and
the [8]reducing of Egypt. After which he [9]advised with Agrippa and
Mecænas, either [10]seriously, or [11]pretendedly, about the [12]laying
down of his [13]authority; Agrippa was for it, Mecænas against it; this
last [14]advice he [15]resolved to follow, but [16]brought a [17]bill
[18]nevertheless into the senate [19]to divest himself of his power,
and by that [20]stratagem got it [21]secured to him both by the senate
and the people, in the year 726.

[22]Cornelius Gallus, a [23]Roman [24]knight, [25]governor of Egypt,
being [26]banished for his [27]insolence, slew himself. Augustus
[28]carried on a war against the Cantabri and Austus for some years, by
his [29]lieutenants: that is to say, from the year 729 to 735, in which
they were entirely [30]reduced by Agrippa; who, upon his [31]return
[32]refused a [33]triumph which was [34]offered him. [35]Phraates, king
of the Parthians, about this time [36]restored the Roman [37]standards
that had been [38]taken from Crassus.

For two of his [39]friends, Mecænas and M. Vipsanius Agrippa, he had
a [40]particular [41]esteem above all others; the [42]former was a
great [43]patron of [44]learning and [45]learned men. Augustus made
Agrippa his [46]son-in-law, by [47]marrying his daughter Julia to him,
whom he had by Scribonia. She had children, C. and L. Cæsars, Agrippa
Posthumus, Agrippina married to Germanicus, Drusus’s son, Livia’s
[48]grandson, and Julia, whom Æmilius married. He took Livia, when she
was [49]big with child, by her former [50]husband Tiberius Nero, by
whom he had no [51]issue, though she had by Nero, Tiberius, who was
emperor afterwards, and Drusus who [52]died in Germany.

Tiberius having gotten the [53]tribunitial [54]power for five years,
was [55]sent to [56]settle the [57]affairs of Armenia. Soon after
he [58]retired to Rhodes, where, for fear of [59]falling under the
[60]displeasure of his [61]step-sons, he [62]continued seven years. But
the [63]occasion of his [64]retirement was his [65]aversion for his
wife Julia, who [66]spent her time in all [67]manner of [68]debauchery.
Augustus, upon a [69]discovery of her [70]pranks, [71]banished her.

The [72]age of this emperor [73]produced several great [74]men:
amongst the [75]Greeks [76]Dionysius Halicarnassensis and [77]Nicholas
Damascenus were [78]famous for their [79]talents in writing
[80]history; and amongst the [81]Latins [82]Cornelius Nepos, Atticus’s
[83]son-in-law, and Sallust, who died four years before the [84]battle
of Actium. In this age lived likewise those [85]celebrated [86]poets,
[87]Virgil, [88]Horace, [89]Ovid, [90]Tibullus, and [91]Propertius.

Augustus died at Nola, in Campania, in the 14th year of [92]Christ,
and the 76th year of his age, having [93]held the empire by himself,
from the death of M. Antony, forty-three years; he was an [94]excellent
[95]prince, and [96]necessary for those times.

He was [97]succeeded by Tiberius, a prince of a [98]savage
[99]disposition, and [100]given up to all manner of debauchery; he
was the son of Livia by Nero. He [101]dissembled his [102]vices at
the [103]beginning of his reign with [104]wonderful [105]art, through
fear of Germanicus, his brother’s son, whom he had [106]adopted at
the [107]command of his [108]father-in-law. For, as he [109]gained a
great [110]reputation by his [111]virtues and [112]exploits in war,
he was [113]looked upon with a [114]jealous eye, as [115]fitter for
the empire than himself. He [116]removed him from Germany where he had
[117]wonderful [118]success against the enemy, into the [119]East,
to [120]fight against the Parthians, in the year 769, having sent
at the same time Cn. Piso into Syria, between whom and Germanicus
was a [121]mortal enmity. Wherefore Germanicus died, not without the
[122]suspicion of having been [123]poisoned by him, for which being
[124]prosecuted at Rome by Agrippina, the wife of Germanicus, he
[125]prevented his [126]sentence by a [127]voluntary death.

[128]Ælius Sejanus, a Roman [129]knight, was afterwards [130]raised by
Tiberius, who after a great many [131]wicked [132]actions, [133]aiming
now at no less than the empire itself, was, by a [134]letter of
Tiberius to the senate, [135]thrown from the [136]top of all his
[137]grandeur, and died by the [138]hand of an [139]executioner, with
all his [140]family, in the 18th year of Tiberius.

About the 18th year of his [141]reign, he [142]retired to Caprea, an
[143]island on the [144]coast of Campania, with a [145]design of never
returning to the town, where he [146]privately [147]wallowed in all
manner of [148]debauchery, and died in the 23rd year of his reign, to
the great [149]joy of every one, being then in the 78th year of his age.

[150]_Jesus Christ_, the son of God, was [151]born of the [152]Virgin
Mary, in the reign of Augustus, and [153]crucified in that of Tiberius,
being then thirty-three years of age.

Caius Cæsar Caligula, so [154]called from a [155]shoe [156]worn by
the [157]soldiery, which, when a boy, he [158]wore in the camp,
[159]succeeded Tiberius, being the son of Germanicus and Agrippina,
the daughter of M. Agrippa and Julia. He was [160]entered into the
five and twentieth year of his age. Great was the joy of the people
upon his first [161]accession to the [162]throne, and no less were
their [163]hopes that he would be [164]like Germanicus his father, who
is said to have been [165]possessed of all the good [166]qualities of
[167]body and [168]mind. And indeed as the worst of princes frequently
[169]begin well, he gave many [170]signs of his [171]moderation and
[172]regard to the good of the public. But soon after, as if he had
[173]put off all [174]humanity, he [175]outstripped the most savage
[176]creatures in [177]cruelty; and having made sad [178]havoc among
all [179]ranks and [180]degrees of men, he [181]killed likewise Macro,
[182]commander of the [183]prætorian [184]bands, by whose [185]means
he had been made emperor. He also [186]committed [187]crimes with
his sisters. Having in a year’s time [188]exhausted [189]immense
[190]treasures that had been [191]left by Tiberius, he [192]fell
to [193]proscribing and [194]plundering. Among other proofs of his
cruelty, he was [195]heard to say, I [196]wish the Roman people had
but one [197]neck. In all his [198]buildings, or public [199]works,
he [200]effected what was [201]looked upon to be impossible. He
[202]ordered himself to be [203]worshipped as a god throughout the
[204]world, and [205]temples to be [206]erected to him. At last, he
was slain by Chærea Cassius, [207]tribune of a [208]cohort of his
[209]guards, and some others, who had [210]entered into a [211]plot
against him, after he had [212]reigned three years, ten months, and
eight days, and [213]lived twenty-nine years.

Claudius Nero, Caligula’s uncle, and the son of Drusius [214]reigned
after him, [215]naturally no bad man, but [216]senseless and foolish.
He was not naturally [217]cruel, but only so when [218]instigated
by others, [219]especially by his [220]freedmen and his [221]wives,
into whose hands he [222]gave up himself and his [223]affairs. His
first lady was Messalina, whose [224]depravity and [225]dissoluteness
every body [226]knew but himself; till at last [227]venturing to
[228]marry one Silius, a knight, she was by her [229]husband’s order
slain, together with her [230]paramour, at the [231]instigation of
[232]Narcissus, who with [233]Pallas, another of his [234]freedmen,
[235]ruled him entirely.

Another [236]instance of his [237]folly is, that after Messalina
was [238]put to death, by whom he had his son [239]Britannicus, and
Octavia, he married Agrippina Germanicus his brother’s daughter, the
mother of Nero by [240]Domitius, in the ninth year of his reign, by
the [241]advice of Pallas: at whose and Agrippina’s [242]request, he
[243]adopted Nero, and [244]passing by Britannicus, [245]designed him
for his [246]successor. He [247]banished the [248]Jews from Rome,
and the [249]mathematicians out of Italy: and [250]undertaking an
[251]expedition into [252]Britain, he [253]subdued it all in sixteen
days time, as Dio says, in the third year of his reign. He died in
the year of Christ 54, by [254]poison [255]put in a [256]mushroom by
Agrippina. He reigned thirteen years eight months and twenty days, and
lived sixty-four years.

Domitius Nero, [257]mounted the throne after the death of his
[258]step-father, being then seventeen years of age. He at first,
[259]behaved himself in such a manner, that he might be [260]reckoned
among the best of [261]princes; that is, as long as he [262]listened
to the [263]precepts of his [264]master Seneca. Afterwards, being
[265]corrupted with [266]luxury and [267]flattery, he [268]became more
like a [269]monster than a man. He [270]stopped the progress of the
Parthians, who had [271]over-run Armenia, by Corbulo, a [272]gallant
[273]commander, and a person of great [274]virtue and [275]authority,
who [276]recovered Armenia, in the ninth year of Nero, and [277]obliged
[278]Tiridates, Volegesis king of the Parthians brother, to [279]come
to Rome, and to [280]beg his [281]crown of Nero, in the thirteenth
year of Nero’s reign; in which year he [282]recalled Corbulo, and put
him to death. He [283]destroyed Britannicus by [284]poison in the
very [285]beginning of his reign. He likewise [286]ordered his mother
Agrippina to be put to death, after having first [287]disgraced and
[288]banished her from the [289]court, which [290]parricide, that
nothing might be [291]wanting to [292]complete the [293]unhappiness
of the times, the Senate [294]approved of. Afterwards having married
Poppæa, whom he [295]took from Otho, he [296]banished Octavia, and at
last put her to death. Upon the [297]discovery of a [298]plot, which
Piso, and some others had [299]laid against him; he put to death the
[300]poet Lucan, and Seneca the philosopher, with several others,
in the year of Christ 65, and the same year he [301]kicked his wife
Poppæa, when [302]pregnant, [303]to death. He had the [304]impudence
to [305]appear upon the [306]stage, and [307]act amongst the
[308]players and [309]harpers, and [310]ride [311]chariot-races at the
[312]Circensian games; and to [313]represent for his [314]diversion
the [315]appearance of [316]Troy in [317]flames, he [318]set fire to
the city, and [319]imputed it to the [320]Christians. He [321]became
so odious and [322]contemptible by his [323]villanies, that he was
[324]forsaken by all, and being [325]sought for in order to be
[326]punished, he [327]performed the [328]executioner’s [329]office
upon himself, in the 14th year of his [330]reign, and 68th of our Lord.

A little before Nero’s death, [331]C. Julius Vindex, who was
[332]proprætor of Gaul, [333]openly [334]rebelled, and [335]persuaded
Sergius Galba, [336]governor of Spain, to [337]set up for emperor,
which he accordingly did, and [338]put Vindex to death presently after.
He reigned about seven months, being very [339]old. He was slain
together with Piso, whom he had [340]adopted, after M. Silvius Otho was
[341]proclaimed emperor; he reigned only about three months.

In the mean time, Vitellius [342]trusting to the [343]legions of
Germany, which he [344]commanded in [345]quality of a [346]consular
[347]lieutenant-general, [348]took upon him the [349]name of emperor,
and [350]defeated Otho’s army in a [351]rencounter near [352]Bebriacum,
who being [353]weary of a civil war, killed himself.

Vitellius reigned eight months after Otho, and was [354]succeeded by
Vespasian, who had been [355]sent by Nero to [356]quell the [357]Jews.
He reigned ten years with the greatest [358]justice and [359]clemency.
He was a great [360]encourager of [361]learning and [362]learned men.
The only thing that was [363]blamed in him, was his [364]covetousness,
which he used to [365]excuse, by [366]alleging the [367]emptiness of
the [368]Exchequer.

The war in [369]Judea was [370]finished in his time, to which he was
sent by Nero, as we have [371]already [372]said. It was [373]begun by
some [374]seditious [375]people that were [376]headed by Eleazar, the
son of Ananias, the [377]high-priest, who [378]took up arms against
the Romans, under the [379]pretence of [380]religion. Cestius Gallus,
[381]lieutenant of Syria, [382]laid siege to [383]Jerusalem, but was
[384]beaten off with great [385]slaughter in the 12th year of Nero. The
[386]victorious Jews upon their [387]return to Jerusalem, amongst other
generals, [388]made choice of [389]Josephus, the son of [390]Matthias
for one. In the year of Christ 67, Vespasian, [391]carrying his arms
through Galilee and Judea, [392]took, besides most of their towns,
Josephus their [393]commander, who [394]foretold his [395]rise.
At last, he [396]fell upon Jerusalem, the [397]metropolis of the
[398]nation, which was taken by his son Titus, in the second year of
his reign.

This [399]proved the [400]ruin of the nation, and of the very name
of the Jews. The [401]calamity was indeed so [402]violent, and
the [403]miseries they [404]suffered so [405]various, that it was
[406]visible they were [407]punished for the [408]horrid [409]murder
of the [410]only begotten son of God; for a [411]dreadful [412]famine
[413]forced the [414]besieged to [415]live on human [416]flesh;
mothers to [417]eat their own children; and eleven hundred thousand
[418]persons (a thing hardly ever [419]heard of before), [420]perished
in that [421]siege. The city was [422]finally [423]razed to the ground.
Vespasian, in the third year of his reign [424]triumphed, with his
son Titus, over the Jews; upon which he [425]shut up the [426]temple
of [427]Janus. He [428]died in his ninth [429]consulship whilst he
was [430]giving [431]audience to some [432]ambassadors, having lived
sixty-nine years, one month and seven days, and reigned eight years.

Titus, who [433]succeeded his father, is [434]deservedly [435]ranked
among the best [436]emperors, although before he [437]came to the
[438]empire, he was [439]thought a man of a cruel [440]temper,
[441]covetous, and [442]depraved. But upon his [443]advancement, he
was so much [444]altered for the better, that he [445]deserved the
[446]title of the [447]delight of [448]mankind. He was [449]remarkable
for great [450]mildness, and [451]easy temper, and never [452]sent any
one away [453]dissatisfied; and [454]remembering once at [455]supper
that he had [456]done nobody any [457]kindness that day, he told all
those who were about him that he had [458]lost a day. In his reign,
in the year of Christ 80, there was a [459]dreadful [460]eruption of
[461]flames and [462]ashes out of [463]mount Vesuvius, which [464]flew
as far as Africa, Syria, and Egypt; and the two towns of Pompeii and
[465]Herculaneum[A] were [466]utterly [467]ruined by it. This good
emperor died in the year of Christ 81, two years and three months
after he had [468]succeeded his father, and in the one and fortieth
year of his [469]age, not without the [470]suspicion of having been
[471]poisoned by his [472]brother Domitian.

    [A] The Manuscripts, Vases, &c. &c. which within the last few
    years have been found among the ruins of these places, are in
    the present day objects of great curiosity and interest.

Titus was very much [473]lamented both by the senate and people: and
their [474]concern for his death was very much [475]increased by his
brother and [476]successor Domitian, the worst prince of all that
[477]came before, or [478]followed after him. At first he made some
[479]show of [480]clemency and [481]justice, but soon [482]discovered
his [483]temper, and [484]imitated Nero in [485]cruelty, [486]rapine,
and [487]debauchery. He [488]ordered himself to be [489]called God,
and was at last [490]destroyed by means of a [491]plot, in the year of
Christ 96, after he had reigned fifteen years.

_(Of Rome, 836--Of Christ, 96.)_


[1]Cocceius Nerva succeeded Domitian in the empire. He reigned but
one year, four months, and eleven days; an [2]excellent prince, but
[3]despised for his age. He [4]annulled all the [5]acts of Domitian,
and [6]restored what had been [7]taken from the people by [8]violence
and [9]injustice: but he [10]wanted [11]authority to [12]keep the
soldiers within [13]due bounds; wherefore those who were [14]concerned
in the death of Domitian, from whom he had [15]received the empire,
were [16]killed by the [17]guards, [18]in spite of all he could do
to [19]prevent it. He made Trajan, [20]lieutenant of Germany, his
[21]adopted son, with whom he lived three months.

Trajan [22]took upon him the [23]government of the empire at
[24]Cologn, being then in the 42nd year of his age; and a man
[25]excellently [26]skilled in the [27]military art. He was likewise
a person of great prudence, [28]moderation, and [29]meekness of
[30]temper; so that he was thought by all to [31]deserve the
[32]surname of [33]Optimus. He [34]added Dacia to the empire, and,
[35]marching into the [36]East, [37]subdued the [38]Armenians,
the [39]Iberians, the [40]Colchians, the [41]Sarmatians, the
[42]Osrhoenians, the [43]Arabians, and the [44]Bosphoranians. He
likewise [45]fell upon the Parthians, and [46]took the cities Seleucia,
[47]Ctesiphon, and [48]Babylon, with several others. But upon his
[49]taking a voyage in the [50]Red Sea, almost all those nations
[51]rose in rebellion. He, however, [52]quickly [53]reduced them
either in person or by his [54]lieutenants. There was in his time
a great [55]earthquake, which [56]ruined the city of [57]Antioch:
it [58]happened in the year of Christ 115, in the [59]consulship of
Messala and Pedo, the latter of whom was [60]buried in the [61]ruins
of the [62]place, and Trajan was [63]drawn through a [64]window, and
had [65]much ado to [66]escape. The Jews of [67]Syrene [68]took up
arms, and [69]exercised all manner of [70]cruelty upon the Romans and
Greeks throughout [71]Egypt and [72]Cyprus. Trajan [73]suppressed this
rebellion with infinite [74]slaughter, by his lieutenant Martius Turbo.
[75]Whilst he was [76]preparing to march against the Parthians, who
were up in arms, having [77]forced from amongst them the king that
had been [78]given them by the Roman emperor; this excellent prince
[79]fell ill, and [80]died at [81]Selinus in Cilicia. He reigned
nineteen years, six months, and fifteen days.

[82]Ælius Hadrianus, Trajan’s [83]cousin and [84]countryman,
[85]obtained the empire after him, by the [86]favour of Plotina,
Trajan’s wife; a man very [87]fickle in his [88]temper and [89]genius,
[90]equally [91]formed for virtue and [92]vice. He [93]went through all
the [94]provinces of the empire, so that nobody had ever [95]travelled
over so much of the [96]world as he. After the death of Trajan, he
[97]abandoned Armenia, Syria, and Mesopotamia, to the Parthians,
and [98]intended likewise to [99]leave Dacia, had he not been
[100]apprehensive of [101]ruining the many thousands of Romans that
were there.

He [102]rebuilt Jerusalem, which he [103]called Ælia Capitolina,
and [104]settled a colony there; and in the same place where the
[105]temple had [106]stood, [107]built another in [108]honour of
[109]Jupiter; which so [110]provoked the Jews, that, [111]taking up
arms, they [112]carried on the war with more [113]fury than ever,
under the [114]conduct of Barchochebas; against whom, amongst other
[115]skilful generals that he [116]employed, Hadrian [117]sent
for Julius Severus out of [118]Britain, by whom the Jews were by
[119]degrees [120]suppressed and utterly [121]destroyed; there being
no less than 50,000 slain in that war, besides an [122]innumerable
[123]multitude that were [124]consumed by [125]famine, [126]pestilence,
and [127]fire; so that [128]Palestine became almost a [129]wilderness.
After that time, the Jews were [130]forbidden, [131]under pain of
death, to come to Jerusalem, unless one day in a year to [132]lament
their [133]misery.

At last Hadrian [134]growing old and [135]infirm, having no
[136]children of his own, [137]adopted [138]Arrius Antoninus, who was
afterwards [139]surnamed [140]Pius, [141]upon condition that he should
adopt Annius Verus, son of Ælius Verus, and [142]M. Aurelius Antoninus.
After which he died at Baiæ, in the year of Christ 138, having lived
sixty-two years, and reigned twenty-one and eleven months.

Antoninus Pius, adopted by Hadrian, [143]governed the Roman empire
with so much virtue and [144]goodness, that he [145]surpassed all
[146]example; for he [147]managed the [148]commonwealth rather with the
[149]affection of a father, than with the authority of a prince, and
[150]kept the world in [151]peace during his whole reign, for which
[152]reason he was [153]compared to Numa. [154]Foreign and [155]remote
princes and [156]nations [157]feared him to that degree, that they
[158]referred the [159]decision of their [160]controversies to him.
He [161]forbade any [162]scrutiny to be made after those, who had
[163]entered into a [164]plot against his [165]life. He died in the
seventieth year of his age, and twenty-fourth of his reign.

After him reigned M. Antonius Verus, [166]son-in-law of Pius; for he
had married his daughter Valeria Faustina. He had from [167]his youth
been [168]educated as well in the [169]knowledge of other [170]arts as
the [171]studies of [172]wisdom, which he [173]made appear no less in
his life and [174]conduct, than his [175]words and [176]professions.
In the [177]beginning of his reign, he made L. Ælius Verus his
[178]partner of the empire, to whom he married his daughter Lucilla.
They reigned together eleven years, being of very [179]different
[180]inclinations; for Verus was of a [181]listless, [182]luxurious,
and [183]morose temper, but was [184]kept within [185]bounds through
the [186]respect he had for his father-in-law; by whom he was [187]sent
against the Parthians, and [188]carried on the war [189]successfully
for four years, by his lieutenants; wherefore they both [190]triumphed
over the Parthians. Afterwards they [191]undertook an [192]expedition
against the Marcomanni, but upon their [193]march, Verus was
[194]seized with an [195]apoplexy, between Concordia and [196]Altinum,
and died. M. Aurelius carried on the war for three years against
the Marcomanni, to whom the Quadi, [197]Vandals, [198]Sarmatians,
and Suevi, [199]joined themselves. His army in [200]want [201]of
water, was [202]relieved by a [203]legion of [204]Christians that
was in it, who, by their [205]prayers [206]procured [207]rain from
[208]heaven, according to [209]Eusebius. The [210]exchequer being
quite [211]exhausted by the great [212]expense of the war, that he
might not [213]burthen the people with [214]taxes, he [215]produced
all the imperial [216]furniture and [217]sold it; and after the
victory [218]restored the [219]price to those [220]purchasers who
[221]were willing to [222]part with what they had [223]bought. Avidius
Cassius, upon [224]false advice that he was [225]dead, [226]seized the
[227]government, and was slain three months after. M. Aurelius died at
Vienna, after a reign of nineteen years, and eleven months.

He was [228]succeeded by his [229]wicked son Aurelius Commodus
Antoninus, who [230]resembled Nero for [231]cruelty, [232]lust,
[233]avarice, and such practices as are [234]scandalous in an emperor.
Having [235]settled his affairs with the [236]Germans, he triumphed
at Rome. He put to death his sister Lucilla, who, with [237]several
others, had [238]conspired against his life. He [239]used to [240]fight
among the [241]gladiators in the [242]public games. He was at last,
after an [243]infamous life, [244]slain by the [245]contrivance of a
[246]mistress, and the captain-general of his [247]life-guards, whom he
had [248]determined to [249]put to death. He reigned twelve years, nine
months, and fourteen days.

After Commodus was [250]killed in the year of Christ 193, P.
[251]Helvius Pertinax, was [252]declared emperor, by those who had
[253]dispatched Commodus, who [254]endeavouring to [255]reduce the
[256]commonwealth into better [257]order, and to [258]curb the
[259]licentiousness of the [260]soldiery, was, within eighty days after
his coming to the empire, [261]murdered by his own guards. The empire
after this, was by the soldiers [262]exposed to [263]sale, and Didius
Julianus [264]coming up to their [265]terms, was [266]accepted of,
and [267]proclaimed emperor accordingly. But [268]not being able to
[269]make up the [270]promised donative, he was [271]forsaken by them,
and slain by [272]order of Septimius Severus, after he had reigned two
months and five days.

This Severus, a [273]native of Africa, was at that time lieutenant
of Pannonia, and [274]took upon him the government, under the
[275]pretence of [276]revenging Pertinax’s death. He first of all
[277]disbanded the guards for that [278]abominable [279]murder. Then
he [280]fell upon Pescennius Niger, lieutenant of Syria, and Clodius
Albinus of [281]Britain, his [282]competitor for the empire. Niger was
[283]conquered, and Antioch, into which he [284]threw himself, was
taken; after which, [285]flying towards the [286]river Euphrates, he
was [287]taken and slain. After the [288]taking off of Niger, Severus
[289]took [290]Byzantium, which had [291]declared for him, after a
[292]siege of three years.

[293]Matters being [294]brought to a [295]peaceable [296]settlement in
the [297]East, he [298]turned his arms [299]westward against Clodius
Albinus, and [300]engaged him at [301]Lyons in [302]France; where
many being slain on both [303]sides, and amongst others, Albinus,
he was [304]left sole [305]possessor of the empire. The city was
[306]plundered and [307]burnt, Albinus’s [308]head [309]sent to Rome,
and a [310]dreadful [311]havoc made among those who had been his
[312]favourers and [313]friends.

After this, he [314]marched [315]eastward again, and [316]conquered the
Parthians, the [317]Adiabenians, and Arabians, whilst Plotianus, in the
mean time, [318]governed all at Rome. Plotilla, this man’s daughter,
was [319]contracted to Antoninus, Severus’s son, and the [320]nuptials
were [321]celebrated in the tenth year of Severus’s reign. But not long
after, Plotianus being [322]engaged in a [323]plot against the emperor,
was slain by his [324]son-in-law, and a great many that had been in his
[325]interest, killed after him.

Severus [326]undertook an [327]expedition into Britain, with his two
sons, in the 15th year of his reign, where he [328]continued three
years; being very [329]successful, he [330]drew a [331]wall [332]across
the [333]island for its [334]security. He died at York, after he had
reigned seventeen years eight months and three days.

[335]Antoninus Caracalla and Geta, the two sons of Severus, were
after him [336]advanced to the empire, in the year of Christ 211.
But the [337]difference of their [338]humour and [339]manners was
such, that they were [340]perpetually at [341]variance. Geta was
of a [342]mild and civil [343]temper, the other [344]cruel and
[345]boisterous, who, in the second year of his reign, [346]slew his
brother in his [347]mother’s [348]bosom. After him, a great many
of his friends and [349]favourers were [350]put to death, amongst
whom the [351]famous [352]lawyer [353]Papinian, because he would not
[354]justify his [355]parricide. After this, he [356]marched into the
[357]East. At Alexandria he made a [358]shocking [359]massacre of the
[360]inhabitants, for having some time before made some [361]jests
upon him. He then [362]invaded [363]Artabanus, king of the Parthians,
and [364]laid waste his [365]dominions. He was [366]killed by the
[367]contrivance of Opilius Macrinus after he had reigned six years and
two months.

Macrinus [368]enjoyed the empire but a short time; for he and his sons
were slain by the [369]soldiers within a year and two months after he
obtained it: and was [370]succeeded by [371]Antoninus Heliogabalus,
[372]supposed, but [373]falsely, to be the son of Caracalla. He was the
[374]vilest [375]wretch that ever lived, [376]given up to all manner of
[377]vice. Wherefore, after a reign of three years, and nine months, he
was slain by the [378]soldiery, with his mother Julia, or Semiamira.

After this, [379]M. Aurelius Alexander [380]mounted the throne,
having been [381]created Cæsar the year before; an [382]extraordinary
prince, and well [383]instructed in all the [384]arts of [385]peace
and war. He [386]carried a strict hand over the [387]judges, and was
very [388]severe upon all those that by [389]favour or [390]bribery
[391]transgressed the [392]bounds of [393]justice. He [394]banished
from his [395]person all [396]flatterers, [397]buffoons, and such as
are a [398]scandal to the [399]court. He [400]forbade the [401]sale
of [402]offices, saying, that what was [403]bought would be [404]sold
again. He [405]allowed the [406]deputies of the [407]provinces all
their [408]furniture out of the [409]exchequer, that they might not
be [410]burdensome to the people. He was [411]successful against the
Persians, but at last slain in a [412]sedition of his army.

In the fifth year of his reign, [413]Artaxerxes, [414]the Persian,
having [415]defeated the Parthians in three [416]battles, and
slain their king Artabanus, [417]raised again the empire of the
Persians in the East. He also made an [418]excursion into the Roman
[419]territories, but was defeated by Alexander. After this, he
[420]undertook an [421]expedition against the Germans, in which he was
slain by Maximinus, together with his mother, after a reign of thirteen
years.

Maximinus was made emperor after the [422]murder of Alexander, and
[423]put a happy end to the German war. In the mean time he made a
[424]dreadful [425]havoc at Rome, by his governor there, and killed a
great many of the [426]nobility. During this, the two [427]Gordians,
father and son, while at [428]Carthage, [429]laid claim to the empire.
The Romans, being [430]headed by the senate, [431]declared against
Maximinus; and [432]persons were [433]dispatched away to [434]secure
the provinces for the senate. At home, twenty [435]commissioners were
[436]nominated for the [437]management of public [438]affairs. The
Gordians being [439]killed in Africa, after a year and a few days, by
[440]Capelian, Maximinus’s general, [441]Balbinus and [442]Maximus
Pupienus, two of the [443]twenty [444]commissioners, were [445]advanced
to the empire by the senate in the year of Christ 237; in which
Maximinus, as he was [446]besieging Aquileia, was slain by the
[447]soldiers with his son, who was but a [448]boy, after a reign of
two years and ten months.

Balbinus and Pupienus, with Gordian ([449]a boy, who, as will be seen
[450]hereafter, [451]perished in Africa), reigned together for a year.
But afterwards being [452]desirous to [453]get rid of Gordian, who was
more in [454]favour than themselves, they were slain by the soldiers
in the year of Christ 238; from which time Gordian [455]enjoyed the
empire by himself, a [456]youth of an [457]extraordinary [458]genius,
and [459]prone to all manner of virtue; which was [460]improved by
the [461]prudence of Misitheus, a very [462]learned and [463]eloquent
man, whose daughter he [464]married; with whom he [465]marched at the
[466]head of the great army against the Persians, and [467]recovered
from them [468]Carræ, [469]Nisibis, and other towns, and [470]forced
them back into their own [471]country. The year [472]following,
Misitheus being [473]murdered by the [474]contrivance of [475]Philip
the Arabian, Gordian himself was soon after slain in a [476]tumult,
which the same Philip [477]raised by the [478]help of some soldiers he
had [479]corrupted, after he had reigned six years, in whose [480]place
the [481]parricide [482]succeeded.

In the fourth year of Philip’s reign, the [483]Secular games were
[484]celebrated at Rome, in the [485]thousandth year of the city. He
was [486]at last [487]slain at Verona, by the soldiers, in the sixth
year of his [488]reign.

Decius, [489]born in [490]Lower Pannonia, a man of great [491]courage
and [492]experience in war, [493]succeeded him. He [494]perished in a
[495]morass in a battle against the [496]Barbarians. This [497]defeat
was [498]occasioned by the [499]treachery of Gallus, who [500]secretly
[501]caballed with the enemy after he had reigned thirty months. This
Gallus being made emperor by the [502]choice of the [503]soldiery, and
having [504]taken his son as a [505]partner in the [506]government,
was slain together with him by the soldiers, two years and four months
after at Interamna, as he was [507]marching against Æmilian, who was
[508]raising a [509]rebellion in Mœtia.

Æmilian did not reign long, being slain three months after his
[510]advancement, and was [511]succeeded by Valerian, with his son
Gallienus, who reigned six years together; during which time the
Roman empire was [512]miserably [513]rent by the Barbarians. Thirty
[514]tyrants [515]started up in several [516]places, according to
[517]Trebellius Pollio. Wherefore Valerian [518]marching against the
[519]Scythians, who had [520]taken [521]Chalcedon, [522]burnt Nice,
and the [523]temple of the [524]Ephesian Diana, and from thence
[525]advancing against Sapores, who [526]was very troublesome to
the [527]Eastern [528]borders, he [529]took him [530]prisoner, and
[531]treated him like a vile [532]slave; for when he [533]mounted
his [534]horse, he [535]set his [536]foot upon his [537]neck, who
[538]bowed down [539]for that purpose. At last he [540]ordered him
to be [541]flayed and [542]salted. This [543]victory over the Romans
[544]happened in the year of Christ 260. After which Odenatus, a
senator of the [545]Palmyrenians, whom Zenobia had [546]married,
[547]bravely [548]repulsed the Persians that still [549]harassed the
[550]borders.

[551]In the mean time Gallienus, wholly [552]given up to [553]luxury
and [554]debauchery, [555]suffered the empire to be [556]torn to pieces
by the Barbarians, and [557]tyrants. Odenatus, after the [558]taking
of Nisibis and Carræ, and the [559]recovery of Mesopotamia, [560]upon
routing of the king of the Persians, having [561]sent the great
[562]lords of the Persians to him in [563]chains, he was [564]not
ashamed to [565]triumph, as if he had [566]conquered them himself.
Odenatus was [567]murdered by his [568]cousin, together with his son
Herod, whose [569]wife Zenobia, being a [570]woman of a [571]masculine
spirit, [572]undertook the government. Gallienus was slain with his
brother Valerian at [573]Milan, as he was marching against Aureolus the
tyrant. He reigned almost seven years with his father, and eight alone.

Claudius [574]succeeded him; a [575]frugal and [576]moderate prince,
and very [577]serviceable to the public, who having [578]taken off
the tyrant Aureolus, was very [579]successful against the [580]Goths,
of whom he [581]slew 320,000, and [582]sunk 200 of their [583]ships.
The rest of the Barbarians were [584]consumed at [585]Hæmimontium by
[586]famine and [587]pestilence; and soon after Claudius [588]died of
the same [589]plague, after a reign of one year and nine months.

His brother Quintilius [590]usurping the empire, was slain by the
soldiers ten days after, who had now [591]made choice of Aurelian,
a person of [592]mean birth, but [593]reckoned amongst the most
[594]glorious princes, only rather too [595]cruel. He [596]subdued
the Alemanni and Marcomanni, from whom the Romans had before
[597]received a [598]signal [599]overthrow. After that victory he
[600]came to Rome, [601]put several of the [602]senators to death, and
[603]enlarged the [604]walls of the city. Then marching [605]eastward,
he conquered Zenobia, whom with the tyrant [606]Tetrichus, he [607]led
in [608]triumph. [609]Aurelius Victor tells us, he was the first of
the Roman emperors who [610]wore a [611]diadem on his [612]head, or
[613]used [614]jewels and [615]cloth of [616]gold. He was [617]taken
off by [618]Mnestheus, a [619]notary to the [620]secretaries at
[621]Cænophrurium, [622]betwixt [623]Byzantium and Heraclea. After
his [624]death, there was an [625]interregnum of about seven months,
[626]occasioned by a [627]dispute between the senate and the army,
about the [628]choice of an emperor; at length Tacitus was [629]chosen
by the senate, a person of [630]excellent [631]morals, and very
[632]fit for the [633]government, he was [634]descended from Tacitus
the [635]historian; and he [636]died of a [637]fever six months after
at Tarsus. His brother Florianus [638]succeeded him: but Probus being
[639]set up by a [640]majority of the army, Florianus [641]bled himself
to death, two months after his brother died, in the year of Christ 276.

This Probus was [642]born in Pannonia Sirmiensis, a very fine man,
and an excellent [643]soldier, of [644]unspotted morals. [645]As
soon as he was [646]made emperor, he [647]punished all those who
[648]had a hand in the death of Aurelian. After that, he [649]marched
to [650]Gaul, [651]recovered several towns out of the [652]hands
of the [653]Barbarians, and [654]slew nearly 70,000 of them. After
[655]reducing [656]Gaul, he recovered [657]Illyricum, and [658]subdued
the people [659]called the [660]Getæ; then going into the [661]East,
he [662]fell upon the [663]Persians; when having [664]defeated them,
and [665]taken several towns, he was [666]slain on his [667]return to
Italy, by the soldiers, at [668]Sirmium, who [669]hated him for his
great [670]severity. This [671]happened in the seventh year of his
[672]reign, and the 282nd of Christ.

Probus was [673]succeeded by M. Aurelius Carus, [674]born at
[675]Narbon in France, who [676]immediately [677]made his sons
Carinus, and Numerianus, [678]Cæsars; and having [679]sent Carinus
to [680]take the care of Gaul, he [681]marched into the [682]East
against the Persians with Numerianus; where, after he had [683]reduced
Mesopotamia, and marched as far as [684]Ctesiphon, he was [685]struck
dead by [686]lightning, having [687]reigned about a year. Numerianus
being much [688]concerned for his father’s death, [689]contracted a
[690]weakness in his [691]eyes with [692]weeping, and was [693]slain by
the [694]contrivance of Aper his [695]father-in-law.

Carinus was nothing [696]like his father and brother, being [697]guilty
of all [698]manner of [699]wickedness; [700]wherefore he was
[701]odious to all [702]ranks of [703]people. He was [704]betrayed
by his own army at [705]Margum in Mœsia, and [706]killed by the
soldiers of Dioclesian, who, as soon as Numerianus was [707]dead,
[708]accepted of the [709]purple [710]offered him by the army, being
born of [711]mean parents in [712]Dalmatia (for [713]he is said
to have been the [714]slave of [715]Anulinus the senator), but a
[716]gallant soldier. He [717]took his [718]oath in an [719]assembly
of the soldiers, that he [720]had no hand in the death of Numerianus,
and upon that [721]slew Aper with his own [722]hand; and so
[723]fulfilled the [724]prophecy of him, that he should be emperor,
when he had killed a [725]boar with his own hand; for which reason
[726]as often as he [727]met with a boar, he [728]used to kill him.
After he had killed Aper, he said he had [729]found the fatal boar.
He [730]suppressed the [731]boors who made an [732]insurrection in
Gaul, and [733]called themselves Bacaudæ, by means of [734]Maximianus
Herculius, whom he [735]sent thither [736]for that purpose in the
year 285, in which this Herculius was first made Cæsar, and the year
[737]following he was made Augustus. About the same time Carausius
having [738]seized upon [739]Britain, and Achilleus in [740]Egypt,
[741]pretended to the empire; and in the [742]East, Narses king of
Persia, being [743]ready to [744]fall upon the Romans, and Africa being
[745]wasted by the [746]Quinquegentians, the better to [747]conduct
all these wars at once, he [748]created Constantius Chlorus, and
Galerius Maximianus, Cæsars. The latter was [749]born in Dacia, not
far from Sardica, and was [750]surnamed [751]Armentarius, because
he had been a [752]herdsman. Dioclesian [753]gave his daughter
Valeria to Armentarius, and Maximianus Herculius [754]disposed of
his step-daughter Theodora to Constantius. After this, Dioclesian
[755]went to Egypt, Herculius into Africa, Armentarius into the East,
and Constantius into Britain. Alexandria was [756]taken by Dioclesian,
after a [757]siege of eight months, in the twelfth year of his reign.
Ceransius was [758]killed by his friend [759]Alectus, eight years after
his [760]revolt. At the same time the Quinquegentians were [761]reduced
by Maximianus Herculius: and Galerius Armentarius [762]defeated by
Narsus, being [763]haughtily [764]received by Dioclesian, he the year
following 297, [765]revenged this [766]disgrace, by [767]routing
the Persian army, and [768]taking the [769]wives, [770]sisters, and
[771]children of Narsus prisoners; upon which Dioclesian received him
[772]honourably in Mesopotamia.

At length, after a [773]splendid [774]triumph, Dioclesian and Herculius
[775]laid down their [776]authority; the former did it [777]by
choice, and [778]retired to Salonæ; the other was [779]prevailed
upon more by the [780]authority of his [781]colleague, than from any
[782]inclination for it. This [783]happened in the 20th of Dioclesian,
and 304th year of Christ; upon which [784]Constantius Chlorus, and
[785]Galerius Maximianus Armentarius, were [786]proclaimed emperors;
Severus, and Galerius Maximianus, the [787]nephew of Armentarius by a
sister, were [788]declared Cæsars. Constantius [789]divided the Roman
empire with Maximian, [790]keeping to himself Gaul, Italy, and Africa;
but the two [791]last he afterwards [792]left to his colleague, who
had besides [793]Illyricum, Asia, and the [794]East. Of this he made
Maximianus [795]governor, and [796]placed Severus in Italy.

CHAP. X.

(_Of Rome_, 1044--_Of Christ_, 304.)


Constantius Chlorus having [1]enjoyed his [2]dignity one year, or
as most [3]will have it, two years, [4]died at York. He was [5]mild
and [6]civil in his [7]disposition; he would [8]suffer no [9]enquiry
to be made after the [10]Christians, and [11]preferred such of his
[12]servants as he [13]knew to be of that [14]profession before the
[15]rest.

Constantine, his son, [16]began his [17]reign in the year of Christ
306, being 32 or 33 years of age, [18]born of [19]Helen of Bithynia,
whom, most [20]authors say, was not, but some, that she was, the
[21]lawful [22]wife of Constantius, though of [23]mean [24]birth.

At Rome, [25]Maxentius, the son of [26]Herculius, was [27]proclaimed
emperor, by the [28]prætorian [29]bands: he, at first, to [30]gain
the [31]people, [32]seemed to [33]favour the [34]Christians; but
[35]presently after [36]wallowed in all [37]manner of [38]wickedness
and [39]cruelty. Galerius Maximianus [40]sent Severus against
him, who, being [41]forsaken by his men, [42]fled to Ravenna;
Galerius, upon this, [43]marching for Rome, with his [44]army, was
[45]likewise forsaken by his men, and went into [46]Illyricum, where
he [47]made Licinius Cæsar. Upon which Herculius [48]being now in
hopes of [49]recovering the empire which he had [50]quitted against
his [51]will, [52]returned from Lucania to Rome, and [53]advised
[54]Dioclesian, [55]living at Carnus in Pannonia, by his [56]letters
to him, to [57]do the like, which he [58]refused. He [59]trepanned
Severus by [60]perjury, and [61]slew him. Then [62]laying a plot
for his son, he was [63]forced to [64]fly from Rome to Constantine
in Gaul, to whom he [65]gave his daughter Faustina in [66]marriage.
But some time after, having [67]entered into a [68]wicked [69]design
against his [70]son-in-law, Constantine, (which was [71]discovered by
his daughter), he [72]fled to [73]Marseilles, and there [74]suffered
the [75]punishment of his [76]treachery. About this time, Galerius
Maximianus [77]died and was by his son-in-law Maxentius [78]enrolled
amongst the [79]gods.

In the year 312, [80]Constantine [81]marched against [82]Maxentius, and
was [83]encouraged to it by the [84]prodigy of a [85]cross he [86]saw
in the [87]heavens. Having [88]passed the [89]Alps, and [90]defeated
his generals near Verona, he [91]routed Maxentius himself not far
from Rome, who [92]flying over a [93]bridge he had [94]laid upon the
[95]Tyber, it [96]broke under him, and he was [97]drowned.

[98]Affairs being [99]settled in the city, Constantine in his
[100]way to Germany, at Milan [101]married his sister [102]Constantia
to Licinius, who had now been [103]made emperor. The same year
Galericus Maximinus, a cruel [104]enemy of the [105]Christians,
[106]undertaking a war against both the emperors, was [107]beaten
by Licinius in [108]Illyricum, and [109]fled into Asia, where he
[110]died a [111]horrible death at Tarsus in Cilicia. Nor did the
[112]agreement betwixt the two [113]princes [114]last long; their first
[115]rencounter was at Cibalis, a town in Pannonia; after which they
had another [116]battle in the [117]plains of Mardia; in both which the
[118]Licinians were [119]entirely defeated. At last a [120]peace was
[121]made, and the empire again [122]divided.

In the year 324, Licinius [123]taking up arms against Constantine,
[124]upon a pretence that he [125]went beyond his [126]bounds,
and had [127]broken into his [128]dominions, received a great
[129]overthrow near Hadrianople. [130]From thence flying into
[131]Byzantium, he was again [132]defeated by [133]sea; and being
[134]routed in another [135]battle near [136]Chalcedon, he was
[137]taken prisoner by Constantine, from whom he [138]procured his
life by the [139]interposition of his sister, and was [140]banished
to [141]Thessalonica, where, [142]endeavouring to make a new
[143]insurrection, he was [144]put to death.

After this, [145]Crispus Cæsar, his son, by a former [146]wife
Minervina, a [147]youth of an [148]extraordinary [149]genius, was put
to death upon [150]suspicion of [151]attempting to [152]seduce his
[153]step-mother; and the year [154]following, Fausta, being [155]found
[156]guilty of [157]falsely [158]accusing him, was [159]suffocated in a
hot [160]bath, by [161]order of her [162]husband Constantine.

In this emperor’s time, Byzantium was [163]rebuilt, and [164]enriched
with the [165]spoils of almost the whole [166]world; so that it
[167]equalled Rome, and [168]took its [169]name from its [170]restorer,
being [171]called [172]Constantinople.

After this, having [173]subdued the [174]Sarmatians, and [175]disposed
of them in several [176]places of the Roman [177]empire; Constantine
died in the [178]suburbs of Nicomedia, where most [179]authors say he
was [180]baptised a little before his [181]death.

He [182]left by Fausta, the daughter of Maximianus, three children,
[183]heirs of the empire, who [184]divided it amongst them. Constantine
the [185]eldest had [186]Gaul, and all [187]beyond the [188]Alps.
[189]Constans the [190]youngest had Rome, Italy, Africa, Sicily, and
the [191]rest of the [192]islands, Illyricum, [193]Thracia, Macedonia,
and [194]Greece. Constantius, the [195]second son, Asia, and the
[196]East, with [197]Egypt.

But the brothers did not long [198]agree; four years after his father’s
[199]death, Constantine making war upon his brother Constans, and
[200]invading his [201]territories, was [202]slain near Aquileia.
Constans himself was slain ten years after by [203]Magnentius’s
general, Gaison, near the [204]Pyrænean mountains. Constantius was
[205]engaged in a [206]dangerous war with this Magnentius. In the
[207]battle [208]fought at Morsa in Pannonia, Constantius’s army was
[209]worsted in the first [210]attack, but at last [211]came off
[212]victorious. Two years after this, Magnentius slew himself at Lyons
in [213]despair.

Gallus was [214]declared Cæsar, and [215]governor of the East;
but [216]abusing his [217]authority, he was [218]sent for by
Constantius, and [219]put to death in Illyricum. [220]Julian, his
brother, was [221]saved by the [222]interposition of Eusebia,
Constantius’s [223]wife, and sent to Athens to [224]study. He was
afterwards [225]advanced to the [226]dignity of Cæsar, [227]married
to the emperor’s sister [228]Helen, and was [229]made governor of
[230]Gaul, where he was very [231]successful against the [232]Germans,
[233]Franks, and [234]Alemans; he [235]sent the [236]king of the
Alemans a [237]prisoner to Constantius at Rome, who [238]envying his
[239]success, [240]endeavoured to [241]draw his soldiers from him,
and [242]send them into the [243]East against the Persians. But they
[244]proclaimed Julian emperor at [245]Paris, [246]whilst Constantius
was [247]preparing for a war against the Persians. [248]As soon as he
[249]understood this, he [250]marched against Julian, but died on the
[251]road near Tarsus.

Julian, after the death of Constantius, was sole [252]master of the
empire. He [253]killed, or [254]banished all the [255]friends of
Constantius; [256]opened the [257]temples of the [258]idols, and
[259]abjuring the [260]Christian [261]faith, was [262]consecrated
[263]high-priest, [264]according to the [265]rites of the [266]pagan
[267]religion. He made war against the Persians, and was [268]slain
in it. They say that, when he [269]perceived his [270]wound to be
[271]mortal, he [272]received the [273]blood in his [274]hand, and
[275]threw it up [276]towards [277]heaven, with these [278]words: “Thou
hast [279]conquered me, O [280]Galilæan!” [281]meaning [282]Christ,
whose religion he had [283]abjured, and hence was called Julian the
Apostate.

After the death of Julian, [284]Jovian, a [285]native of Pannonia,
was [286]proclaimed emperor by the [287]soldiers. He [288]ordered the
temples of the idols to be [289]shut up, and their [290]sacrifices to
be [291]abolished. He made an [292]inglorious peace with Sapor, king of
the Persians, for thirty years, by which he [293]yielded up Nisibis,
and the greatest [294]part of Mesopotamia. He died in his [295]return
to Constantinople, in the [296]confines of Galatea and Bithynia.

In the year of Christ 364, [297]Valentinian was [298]chosen emperor at
Nice, and not long after [299]gave the [300]title of [301]Augustus to
his brother [302]Valens; and [303]leaving him in the East, [304]came
into the [305]West himself. He had a great many good [306]qualities,
but was [307]particularly [308]famed for his [309]love of [310]justice.
He made war against the Alemanni, [311]Saxons, Quadri, and other
[312]nations. He [313]died in Pannonia, of an [314]apoplexy, in the
55th year of his [315]age, and the 12th of his [316]reign.

His brother Valens [317]suppressed Procopius, a [318]relation of
[319]Julian, who had [320]assumed the [321]purple at Constantinople.
After which he made war with the [322]Goths; but upon the [323]suit
of their king [324]Athanaricus, [325]granted them a [326]peace, in
the year 369. Ten years after this, Athanaricus with Fritigernes,
were [327]driven out of their [328]country by the [329]Huns, and were
[330]kindly [331]received by Valens, and [332]settled with their Goths
in [333]Thrace. They afterwards excited an [334]insurrection against
the Romans, and Valens being [335]wounded in a [336]battle with them,
near [337]Hadrianople, was [338]burnt [339]alive by the barbarians,
in a [340]cottage he [341]fled to. He reigned fourteen years and four
months.

The emperor Valentinian had two sons, [342]Gratian and Valentinian.
The former he [343]declared Augustus in Gaul, in the year 367; and
his other son was [344]immediately after the death of his father
[345]advanced to the same [346]dignity by the soldiers, in the year
375, and the 10th year of his age. Gratian had an [347]aversion to
[348]public [349]business. After the death of Valens, the Goths
[350]over-running Thrace, and other [351]provinces of the Roman empire,
not [352]being able alone to [353]bear the [354]burthen, he [355]sent
for [356]Theodosius out of [357]Spain, and made him his [358]associate,
who was then in the 33rd year of his age.

Theodosius having [359]conquered the barbarians, [360]restored the
public [361]peace. At last the whole [362]nation of the Goths, with
their king, [363]delivered themselves up to the Romans, to whom
the emperor [364]assigned [365]lands. After these things, Maximus
[366]seized the [367]government in [368]Britain, in the year 382;
and having [369]fixed his imperial [370]seat at Triers, [371]basely
killed Gratian at Lyons, after he had been [372]forsaken by his
army; but Theodosius [373]revenged his death, and [374]likewise
[375]re-established Valentinian the [376]younger, who had been
[377]obliged to [378]quit Italy. This [379]happened in the year 388, in
which he [380]overthrew and killed Maximus near Aquileia. Theodosius
had all the [381]accomplishments [382]becoming a Christian emperor:
[383]inferior to none of the [384]foregoing or [385]following princes;
a [386]consummate general, never [387]undertaking any war but such as
was [388]necessary; of [389]singular [390]clemency and [391]humanity,
yet a little [392]inclined to [393]passion.

In the year 391, Eugenius, [394]supported by the [395]power of
Arbogastes, [396]set up for emperor, and in the following year,
Valentinian was slain at Vienne in Gaul, by the same Arbogastes. Two
years after, [397]Eugenius was [398]routed, [399]taken prisoner,
and put to [400]death by Theodosius. Arbogastes was his own
[401]executioner. The year following, 395, this excellent emperor died
at Milan, after a reign of sixteen years.

Theodosius [402]left two sons, [403]Arcadius and [404]Honorius; to
the [405]former he [406]gave the [407]East, to the [408]latter the
[409]West. Arcadius, [410]immediately after his father’s death,
[411]married Eudoxia, which [412]match was [413]brought about by
Eutropius, [414]for fear of his [415]taking to wife Ruffinus’s
daughter. This Ruffinus in the East, and Stilicho in the West, were
at that time two men of the greatest [416]eminence and [417]power
in the empire. Stilicho, after the death of Theodosius, [418]laying
claim to the [419]management of both the Eastern and Western empires,
and [420]marching [421]Eastward, Ruffinus [422]endeavoured [423]to
hinder him, by [424]posting his [425]troops in all the [426]passages
into [427]Greece, and [428]sent for Alaricus, king of the Goths, who
[429]over-ran Greece, but was [430]defeated by Stilicho. At last,
Ruffinus was [431]slain by the [432]soldiers, the same year in which
Theodosius died. After his death, Eutropius [433]became very intimate
with Arcadius, but was at last [434]disgraced and slain, in the very
year in which he was [435]consul. In 403, died Arcadius, a prince
of a [436]peaceable, but [437]indolent [438]temper, and too much
[439]governed by his [440]wife. He left the [441]guardianship of his
son, by [442]will, to Jezdegirdes, king of the [443]Persians, who
[444]faithfully [445]executed that [446]trust, and [447]committed the
[448]care of his [449]ward to Antiochus, a very [450]learned man,
who [451]threatened to make war upon any that should [452]offer to
[453]disturb him.

In the West, the [454]frequent [455]invasions of the barbarians were
almost [456]fatal to the Roman [457]state. Radagisus, king of the
Goths, with four, or as [458]others [459]say, two hundred thousand
men, [460]invaded Italy, who were very [461]happily [462]cut off by
Stilicho, the general himself being [463]taken and [464]slain. After
Alaricus, a king of the [465]Goths, having [466]laid [467]Greece waste,
and [468]continued a long time in [469]Epirus, at the [470]instigation
of Stilicho, who was [471]desirous to [472]take [473]Illyricum
from Arcadius, in order to [474]annex it to the [475]dominions of
Honorius, afterwards [476]penetrated into Italy. To [477]get rid of
him, Honorius [478]gave him [479]Spain and Gaul to [480]live in,
himself not being in a condition to [481]keep those [482]provinces. As
Alaricus was [483]marching thither, Saul, a [484]pagan general, whom
Stilicho had [485]placed at the [486]head of an army, [487]falling
upon the Barbarians, was [488]defeated by them. This [489]success so
[490]elevated Alaricus, that [491]quitting his [492]former [493]design,
he [494]over-ran Italy, and [495]took Rome: but before this, Stilicho
was [496]put to death by the [497]order of Honorius. For, after the
death of Theodosius, [498]designing to get the empire to himself and
to make his son [499]Eucherius, who was a [500]pagan, and an enemy
to the [501]Christians, emperor; the better to [502]accomplish his
[503]design, he [504]resolved to [505]throw all into [506]confusion.
[507]Wherefore he sent for the Barbarians to [508]ravage the
empire, and [509]let the Alans, the Vandals, the Suevi, and the
Burgundians, loose upon France and Spain. His [510]relation to the
emperor [511]encouraged him in it; for he had Serena, the daughter of
Theodosius’s brother, in [512]marriage, and had [513]disposed of the
two daughters he had by her, first, [514]Mary, and after her death,
[515]Termantia, in marriage to Honorius. But these [516]intrigues
being [517]discovered by [518]Olympius, in the year of Christ 408, he
was slain by the [519]hands of [520]Heraclius. The year following,
Eucherius was [521]put to death, with his mother Serena. After Stilicho
was [522]taken off, Alaricus was [523]desirous to [524]come to an
[525]accommodation with Honorius, but was [526]foolishly [527]rejected.
Wherefore, with a [528]body of [529]Goths, and [530]Huns, in
[531]conjunction with his wife’s brother [532]Athaulfus, he [533]laid
siege to Rome, and [534]carried it in the year 410. The [535]plunder
of it he [536]gave to his soldiers, but with orders that all such as
[537]fled to the [538]churches, [539]especially those of [540]Peter and
[541]Paul, should have [542]quarter given them. He then [543]went to
[544]Rhegium, in order to [545]pass over into Sicily and Africa, but
there [546]died. He was [547]succeeded by Athaulfus, who [548]plundered
Rome again, [549]carried off Placidia the emperor’s sister, and
[550]married her.

During this [551]storm in Italy, the same [552]calamity [553]fell
upon Gaul and Spain. The Alans, Vandals, Suevans, [554]laid waste
Gaul, passed the [555]Pyrenæan mountains, and [556]made themselves
[557]masters of Spain in the year 409. The Vandals and Suevans
[558]seized upon Galæcia; the Alans, Lusitania and the [559]province of
[560]Carthage; the [561]Silingans, which was another [562]branch of the
Vandals, Bœtica.

After the [563]breaking in of the Goths in 410, [564]divers
[565]pretenders to the empire [566]started up in [567]several
[568]places. First Attalus was [569]made emperor, by the [570]senate,
at the [571]command of Alaricus. He [572]proudly [573]rejected
Honorius, who [574]offered by his [575]ambassadors to [576]receive him
as his [577]partner in the empire, but was [578]obliged by Alaricus
to [579]return to a [580]private [581]condition, and was afterwards
[582]put up and [583]down again several times. At length, [584]renewing
his [585]pretensions in Gaul, but not being [586]supported by the
[587]Goths, he was [588]taken [589]prisoner, and [590]put into the
[591]hands of Honorius, who [592]spared his [593]life, but [594]cut off
one of his hands.

[595]Martius Gratianus, and Constantine in [596]Britain, [597]usurped
the [598]supreme [599]power, and were [600]taken off. [601]Jovin and
[602]Sebastian, two brothers, then [603]pretended to the empire; but
were [604]taken and [605]slain by [606]Athaulfus, king of the Goths.
[607]Heraclianus was set up in Africa, and [608]venturing over into
Italy against Honorius, was [609]routed by Marinus at [610]Utriculum;
and [611]returning into Africa, was slain at [612]Carthage.

In the year 415, Athaulfus was slain by a Goth, and [613]succeeded
by Sigericus, who was destroyed seven days after; and succeeded by
Vuallia, who [614]made peace with the Romans, and [615]restored
Placidia to Honorius; after which he made war against the Alans,
Vandals, Suevi, and other [616]nations, who had [617]settled in
Spain. Honorius [618]married Placidia against her [619]will to
[620]Constantius Comes, who [621]confirmed the peace with Vuallia,
[622]sent for him back into Gaul, and [623]gave him that part of
[624]Aquitain which [625]lies betwixt Thoulouse and the [626]sea,
to [627]live in. Upon this, Thoulouse [628]became the [629]capital
of the [630]Gothic, or [631]Visigothic [632]kingdom in Gaul. This
[633]happened in the year 419. In the year following, Honorius, against
his [634]will, made Constantius his [635]companion in the empire, who
died seven months after, as did Honorius himself in the year 428.

He was [636]succeeded by Valentinian his sister’s son. In his reign the
Vandals, whom Boniface had hitherto [637]repulsed from the [638]shores
of Africa, [639]entered it from Spain, under the [640]command of
Geisericus. For Boniface being [641]impeached by [642]Ætius of
[643]high-treason, and [644]Sigisvulphus being [645]sent against him,
[646]finding himself not a [647]match for the Romans, [648]fled to
the Vandals for [649]assistance, with whom he had [650]contracted an
[651]alliance before. Wherefore in the year 427, Geisericus, with
80,000 Vandals and Alans, [652]passed over into Africa, and [653]made
himself master of it. In the mean time, Boniface being [654]reconciled
to Placidia, and not [655]being able to [656]persuade the Barbarians,
to [657]return home, [658]endeavoured to [659]oblige them, by
[660]force of arms, and was [661]routed. He then [662]went to Rome, and
died there soon after.

Ætius in Gaul [663]sustained his part very well for the Romans,
against the Franks, Goths, Burgundians, Huns, and other Barbarians.
Ætius had [664]sent for the Huns to his assistance against the
Goths. In the year 434, Honoria, the sister of Valentinian, being
[665]banished the [666]court for [667]improper conduct with her
[668]steward, and sent to Theodosius, emperor of the [669]East,
[670]engaged Attila, king of the Huns, to make war upon the [671]West.
[672]Litorius, a Roman general, having the [673]command of them, whilst
he [674]endeavoured to [675]eclipse the [676]glory of Ætius, was so
[677]foolish as to [678]regard the [679]answers of [680]soothsayers and
[681]fortune-tellers, and [682]rashly [683]engaged [684]Theodoricus,
king of the Goths, who by the most [685]abject [686]submission
[687]declined the war, and after a great [688]overthrow was
[689]taken and [690]slain in the year 439, in which [691]Carthage was
[692]surprised by the Vandals. At last, in the year 442, Valentinian
[693]renewed the peace with Geisericus, and Africa was [694]divided
between them.

In the year 450, Attila [695]marched into Gaul, which at that time
the [696]Visigoths, Franks, Burgundians, Alans, and other Barbarians,
were in [697]possession of. Part of the Romans [698]reluctantly
[699]remained under the [700]command of Ætius, who alone at that time
[701]kept the [702]western [703]empire from [704]falling [705]to utter
[706]ruin. Attila [707]laid siege to Aurelia, but Ætius [708]coming
upon him, [709]obliged him to [710]raise the [711]siege, and
[712]pursued him into Gallia, and Belgium then [713]overthrew him, in
a great [714]battle [715]fought on the [716]plains of Catalonia. There
were [717]slain on both [718]sides at least 170,000, and amongst them
Theodoricus king of the Goths. It is [719]certain the Huns might have
been [720]utterly [721]destroyed, if Ætius had not [722]been afraid,
that in the event of the Huns being [723]entirely [724]cut off, the
Goths would be [725]insupportable in Gaul.

Attila having [726]unexpectedly [727]escaped, [728]poured his
[729]troops into Italy, where he laid siege to Aquileia, and
[730]levelled it with the ground. He afterwards [731]laid waste
[732]Milan, [733]Ticinum, and other [734]towns; and [735]marching for
Rome, was so [736]wrought upon by an [737]embassy from [738]Leo, who
[739]met him at the [740]river Mincius, that he [741]went into his
own [742]country; afterwards [743]returning into Gaul against the
Alans, who had [744]posted themselves beyond the Loire, he was again
[745]defeated by [746]Thorismundus, as he had been in the [747]plains
of Catalonia; and in the year 454, after an [748]excess of [749]wine,
died of [750]vomiting [751]blood.

It is [752]said the city of [753]Venice [754]owes its [755]origin
to that [756]inroad of the Barbarians, most of the Italians,
[757]especially those of [758]Patavium, [759]flying from the [760]fire
and [761]ruins of their cities to some [762]rocks and [763]desert
[764]islands in the [765]sea for [766]refuge.

Valentinian, upon the death of his mother Placidia, [767]let loose
the [768]reins of [769]power and [770]abused his [771]authority, for
the [772]gratification of his [773]baseness and [774]cruelty. He
[775]seduced the [776]wife of Maximus the senator, [777]put Ætius
to death, after Maximus had by his [778]crafty [779]contrivances
[780]rendered him [781]suspected, in the year 454; and the year
following, by the contrivance of the same Maximus, he was [782]stabbed
by Ætius’s [783]life-guard in the [784]field of [785]Mars, being
thirty-six years of age, and in the 31st of his reign. [786]Eudoxia,
the [787]consort of Valentinian, to [788]revenge the death of her
[789]husband, [790]sent for Gensericus out of Africa, into Italy.
Maximus, upon his [791]arrival, [792]endeavoured to [793]save himself
by [794]flight, but was [795]torn in pieces by his own men, and
[796]thrown into the [797]Tiber, after a [798]reign of [799]hardly
two [800]months. Gensericus, after he had [801]taken the city, was
so [802]affected by an [803]address of [804]Pope Leo’s, that he did
not [805]set it on fire, or [806]put any to the sword; but [807]made
plunder of all the [808]wealth of the [809]place, both [810]sacred
and [811]profane, for fourteen days together; and [812]carried off
Eudoxia, with her two daughters, Eudocia and Placidia, into Africa: the
[813]former of which he [814]married to his son [815]Hunericus.

In the mean time, [816]Avitus Gallus being proclaimed emperor by the
[817]Gallic [818]army at Thoulouse, made peace with the Goths; at whose
[819]persuasion, Theodoric [820]entering Spain, [821]conquered the
Suevi, and [822]killed their king [823]Richiarius in the year 456.

After him, [824]Majorianus [825]took the [826]government upon him
at Ravenna; a [827]prince of a [828]great [829]soul, who being
[830]desirous to [831]recover Africa, was going to Gensericus, under
the [832]title of [833]ambassador; but being [834]seized by Ricimer at
Dertona, and [835]obliged to [836]resign, was [837]put to death in the
year 461, after a reign of four years and four months.

Ricimer [838]raised Severus for emperor, [839]according to an
[840]agreement between them, and [841]poisoned him in the fourth year
of his reign.

After this, there was an [842]interregnum of a year, and some
months, till Anthemius was [843]sent into the West by [844]Leo,
emperor of the [845]East, between whom and [846]Ricimer, it had been
[847]agreed he should be [848]declared emperor, and his daughter should
[849]marry Ricimer. Thus the barbarian being [850]made Anthemius’s
[851]son-in-law, with his [852]wonted [853]treachery, first [854]raised
a civil war against him, and then [855]put him to death at Rome, after
he had [856]reigned five years and some months.

[857]Olybrius was then [858]put up in the [859]room of Anthemius by
Ricimer, who [860]died forty days after Anthemius’s death: nor [861]was
he long survived by Olybrius, for he died the same year, about seven
months after his [862]promotion.

[863]He was followed by [864]Glycerius, who [865]took the
[866]government upon himself at Ravenna, in the year 473, and reigned a
year and four months. He was [867]succeeded by [868]Julius Nepos, who
was [869]killed about five years after his [870]advancement.

[871]Momyllus, who was [872]likewise [873]called [874]Augustulus,
was [875]set up by his father [876]Orestes, being the [877]last
of all the emperors in the [878]West; for [879]Odouacer, king of
the [880]Turcilingans, with the [881]Scyrans, and [882]Herulans,
[883]seized Italy, and after having [884]slain Orestes and his brother
[885]Paul, [886]banished Augustus into Campania. Thus [887]ended the
[888]empire of the West. In the year of [889]Christ 476.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
