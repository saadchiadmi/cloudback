THE DIRECTOR'S VADE MECUM.

_Question._ What is your duty as a Director?

_Answer._ To give my name to a prospectus.

_Q._ Is there any necessary formality before making this donation?

_A._ Yes; I am to accept a certain number of qualifying shares in the
company obtaining the advantage of my directorial services.

_Q._ Need you pay for these shares?

_A._ With proper manipulation, certainly not.

_Q._ What other advantages would you secure by becoming a Director?

_A._ A guinea an attendance.

_Q._ Anything else?

_A._ A glass of sherry and a sandwich.

_Q._ What are your duties at a Board Meeting?

_A._ To shake hands with the Secretary, and to sign an attendance
book.

_Q._ What are your nominal duties?

_A._ Have not the faintest idea.

_Q._ Would it be right to include in your nominal duties the
protection of the interests of the shareholders?

_A._ As likely as not.

_Q._ Would it be overstating the case to say that thousands and
thousands of needy persons are absolutely ruined by the selfish
inattention of a company's direction?

_A._ Not at all--possibly understating it.

_Q._ I suppose you never read a prospectus to which you put your name?

_A._ Never.

_Q._ Nor willingly wish to ruin any one?

_A._ No; why should I?

_Q._ You are guilty of gross ignorance and brutal indifference?

_A._ Quite so.

_Q._ And consequently know that, according to the view of the Judges,
you are above the law?

_A._ That is so.

_Q._ And may therefore do what you like, without any danger to your
own interests?

_A._ To be sure.

_Q._ And consequently will do what you best please, in spite of
anything, and anybody?

_A._ Why, certainly.

At a meeting of the International Maritime Congress "M. GATTO read
a paper on Harbour Lights." Does this mean that one of the Adelphoi
GATTI read the paper (extract from the play, or perhaps a play-bill)
on _Harbour Lights_, which was an Adelphi success? Of course one of
"the GATTI'S" would be in the singular "M. GATTO." The paper was much
applauded, and GATTO _prends le gâteau_.

MUSIC FOR THE MULTITUDE;

OR, BELMONT ON THE EMBANKMENT.

_A Morality (adapted from the "Merchant of Venice") for Men in
Municipal Authority._

    ["The music on the Embankment during the pressman's
    dinner-hour is a much more important matter than it seems to
    be. It would be a most beneficial institution for all indoor
    labourers; for it is not the long hours of labour--though
    they are bad enough--so much as its monotony that makes it so
    wearisome."--_Mr. James Payn in "Our Note Book."_]

  _Lorenzo_  A Journeyman Printer.
  _Jessica_  His "Young Woman."

SCENE--_The Thames Embankment Garden._

  _Lorenzo._ Sweetheart, let's in; they may expect our coming.
  And yet no matter:--why should we go in?
  The Toffs at last, have had compassion on us,
  Within the house, or office, mewed too long,
  And bring our music forth into the air.

    [_They take a seat._

  How bright the sunshine gleams on this Embankment!
  Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music
  Creep in our ears: soft green and Summer sunlight
  Become the touches of sweet harmony.
  Sit, JESSICA: look, how this green town-garden
  Is thickly crowded with the young and old:
  There's not the smallest child which thou behold'st
  But by his movements shows his young heart sings,
  As though poor kids were young eye'd cherubim:
  Such love of music lives in simple souls;
  But whilst grim pedants and fanatics sour
  Have power to stop, they will not let us hear it!

    [_Musicians tune up._

  Hullo! The _Intermezzo_. Like a hymn
  With sweeter touches charming to the ear,
  The soul's drawn home by music.

    [_Music._

  _Jessica._ I'm always soothed like when I hear nice music.

  _Lorenzo._ The reason is your spirits are responsive.
  For do but note a wild and wanton mob
  Of rough young rascals, like unbroken colts,
  Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and blaring loud,
  Which shows the hot condition of their blood;
  If they, perchance, but hear a brass-band sound,
  Or harp and fiddle duet touch their ears,
  Or even _Punch's_ pan-pipe, or shrill "squeaker,"
  You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
  Their wandering eyes turned to an earnest gaze,
  By the sweet power of music: therefore poets
  Tell us old Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods,
  Since naught so blockish, hard, insensible,
  But music for the time doth change his nature.
  The man who would keep music to himself,
  Grudging the mob all concord of sweet sounds,
  Is fit for Bedlam, not the County Council!
  The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
  And his affections cold as Arctic bergs.
  Let no such man be trusted!--Mark the music!

_Old Parliamentary Pictor soliloquiseth_:--

  "_As when a painter, poring on a face,
  Divinely thro' all hindrance finds the man
  Behind it, and so paints him that his face,
  The shape and colour of a mind and life,
  Lives for his children, ever at its best
  And fullest._"

              Aye, my ALFRED, there you hit
  The portrait-painter's function to a hair;
  And here I hit the essential inner JOE.
  And so he'll live. But "ever at his best,
  And fullest?" Humph! His Brummagem retinue
  Will scarce acknowledge _that_. Some call him "JUDAS,"
  But that is rude, and leads to shameful rows.
  Chaff is one thing and insolence another;
  E'en caricature may pass, so that its impulse
  Be humorous not malevolent; but coarse spleen,
  Taking crude shape in truthless graphic slander,
  Is boyish work,--bad manners and bad art!
  And so TAY PAY transgressed the bounds of taste,
  And led to shameful shindy. HEROD? Humph!
  _That_ flout "lacked finish," as great DIZZY said,
  _He_ pricked, not stabbed, was fencer, not brute-bruiser,
  But he of Brummagem hath much to learn
  In gentlemanly sword-play.
                  "Devil's Advocate!"
  That hits him off, I think! _Not_ Devil,--no!
  (Though angry blunderheads will twist it that way)
  But ruthless slater of the pseudo-saint!
  The pseudo-saint, I own, looks limp and floppy,
  Half-fledged and awkward at the cherub _rôle_.
  Poor saint! He's had much mauling, must have more,
  Ere he assumes the nimbus, and I would
  That he looked less lop-sided. Yes, my JOE!
  You'll spot some "human failings" I've no doubt.
  To exercise your "double million magnifyin'
  Gas microscopes of hextra power" upon.
  Your "wision" is not "limited" by "deal doors"
  Or "flights o' stairs," or friends, or facts, or fairness,
  You hardly need suggestions diabolic
  From that hook-nosed attorney at your elbow
  To urge you to the attack; erect, alert,
  Orchid-adorned, and eye-glass-armed, you stand
  The sharpest, shrewdest, most acidulous,
  Dapper and dauntless "Devil's Advocate"
  That ever blackened a poor "saint" all over
  Othello-wise, or robbed a postulant
  For canonisation of a hopeful chance
  Of full apotheosis, and the right
  Of putting on the nimbus.
                    There, 'tis finished:
  And--on the whole--'twere well I had not limned it!
  'Twas tempting, yes, and pleasant in the painting,
  But--well, I've paid for it, and much misdoubt
  If it was worth the price. Followers applaud,
  I--suffer. Oh, that mob of scuffling men,
  Clawing and cursing, while the gallery hissed!
  _Hissed_--not a pothouse outpour in full fight,
  Not clamorous larrikins, or rowdy roughs
  By prize-ring or on race-course fired with drink,
  But England's Commons settling--with their fists
  A Constitutional Contest! Shame, O shame!
  And much I fear my Art must _somewhat_ share the blame!

A VISIT TO BORDERLAND.

[Illustration]

  I called on Mr. STEAD last week, at least I seemed to call,
  For in this "visionary" world one can't be sure at all;
  And when I reached the great man's house he shook me by the hand,
  And talked, as only STEAD can talk, of Spooks and _Borderland_,
  I own that I was tired of men who live upon the earth,
  They hadn't recognised, I felt, my full and proper worth;
  "They'll judge me much more fairly," I reflected, "when they're
          dead,--
  So I'll go and seek an interview with WILLIAM THOMAS STEAD."

  The reason why I went to STEAD is this: the great and good
  Has lately found that English ghosts are much misunderstood;
  Substantial man may swagger free, but, spite of all his boasts,
  STEAD holds there is a future, and a splendid one, for ghosts.
  And so he has an office, a sort of ghostly COOK'S,
  Where tours may be contracted for to Borderland and Spooks;
  And those who yearn to mix with ghosts have only got to go
  And talk, as I conversed, with STEAD for half an hour or so.

  The ghosts have got a paper too, the _Borderland_ I spoke of,
  Where raps and taps are registered that scoffers make a joke of:
  A medium's magazine it is, a ghostly gazetteer
  Produced by WILLIAM THOMAS STEAD, the Julianic seer.
  And everything that dead men do to help the men who live,
  The chains they clank, the sighs they heave, the warnings that
          they give,
  The coffin-lids they lift at night when folk are tucked in bed,
  Are all set down in black and white by WILLIAM THOMAS STEAD.

  While wide-awake he sees such shapes as others merely dream on;
  For instance there is JULIA, a sort of female dæmon;
  Like some tame hawk she stoops to him, she perches on his wrist--
  In life she was a promising, a lady journalist;
  And now that death has cut her off she leaves the ghostly strand
  And turns her weekly copy out by guiding WILLIAM'S hand.
  Yet, oh, it makes me writhe like one who sits him down on tin tacks
  To note that happy ghost's contempt for grammar and for syntax.

  Well, well, I called on STEAD, you know; a doctor's talk of diet is,
  And STEAD'S was of his psychic food as cure for my anxieties.
  I thought I'd take a chair to sit (it looked to me quite common) on,
  "You can't sit there," observed the Sage; "that's merely a
          phenomenon."
  Two ladies, as I entered, seemed expressing of their gratitudes
  For help received to Mr. STEAD in sentimental attitudes;
  They saw me, pirouetted twice, then vanished with a high kick.
  "It's nothing," said the Editor; "they are not real, but psychic."

  These things, I own, surprised me much; I fidgetted uneasily;
  "Why, bless the man, he's had a shock!" said Mr. STEAD, quite
          breezily.
  "_We_ do these things the whole year round, it's merely knack to
          do them;
  A man who does them every day gets quite accustomed to them.
  This room of mine is full of ghosts,"--it sounded most funereal--
  "I've only got to say the word to make them all material.
  I'll say it promptly, if you wish; they cannot well refuse me."
  But my eagerness had vanished, and I begged him to excuse me.

  "Now JULIA," he continued, "is in many ways a rum one,
  But, whatever else they say of her, they can't say she's a dumb one.
  She speaks--she's speaking now," he said. "I wonder what she'll
          tell us.
  What's that? She says she likes your looks; she wants to make me
          jealous."
  That gave me pause, and made me think 'twas fully time I went; it is
  A fearful thing to fascinate these bodiless non-entities.
  Of course when people go to Rome they act like folk at Rome, you
          know,
  But flirting didn't suit my book--I've got a wife at home, you know.

  Well, next I felt a gust of wind, "That's Colonel BONES," my host
          said;
  "He's dropped his helmet" (think of that, a helmet on a ghost's
          head).
  "I don't much care," he whispered this, "in fact, I can't endure
          him;
  Dragoons do use such awful words; I've tried in vain to cure him."
  I ventured to suggest to STEAD that rather than be bluffed I
  Would make this cursing soldier-ghost turn out in psychic mufti;
  He couldn't drop his helmet then, nor threaten with his sabre.
  "I've tried to," said the Editor, "it's only wasted labour.

  "I've sought advice," continued STEAD, "from CANTUAR and EBOR,
  They hinted that they couldn't stand a she-ghost and a he-bore.
  I tried to get a word or two from men of arts and letters,
  They said they drew the line at Spooks who made a noise with
          fetters.
  And when I talked of bringing men and ghostly shapes together
  The Bishops tapped their foreheads and conversed about the weather.
  In fact"--he grew quite petulant--"in all this world's immensity
  I'd back the Bench of Bishops to beat the rest in density."

  And so he talked, till suddenly--(perhaps he's talking still;
  In talking of his own affairs, he has a wondrous skill)--
  There came a noise, as if Old BONES had let off all his blanks at
          once,
  As if a thousand theorists were turning all their cranks at once;
  It seemed to lift me off my legs, and seize me by the hair,
  And sweep me mute but terrified through all the spook-filled air.
  And, when I got my senses back, I vowed no more to tread
  The paths that lead to Borderland, nor ask advice of STEAD.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

_Pietro Ghisleri_ is another success for that charming writer MARION
CRAWFORD. The style is everything. The story is not of so thrilling a
nature as to be absorbing, but it is sufficiently interesting--for the
Baron, at least, with whom M.C.--"Master of his Craft"--is a great
favourite. "Odd, though," murmurs the Baron to himself, and he seldom
murmurs about anything; "odd that a writer like our MARION should,
in Vol. II., p. 35, pen such a sentence as this: "There are plenty
of others whom you may care for more than I." Of course the author
intends _Maddalena del' Armi_, who utters these words, to convey to
her listener and to the reader that "There are plenty of others for
whom you may care more than (you care) for me." How does "than I" get
into this sentence, unless it is to mean "There are plenty of others
for whom you may care more than I care for them"--_quod est absurdum_."
It is unfortunate that the pivot on which the plot turns is so highly
improbable as to be almost impossible, for is it not most unlikely
that any Catholic, educated or uneducated, should ever _write_ her
confession to her confessor, and send it by post, instead of going to
him, and making it by word of mouth? She must have known that, in
so doing, she was making no confession at all, _i.e._, in the
restrictedly religious sense of the word. While she was about it, she
might as well have inclosed a stamped and addressed envelope for the
absolution to be sent by return. This is the hinge of the story; and
it is a very weak one. Mr. CRAWFORD recognises this when his
other characters casually discuss the probability of _Adèle's_
having done such a thing. However, grant this, which is almost as
easily done as granting superhuman strength to a Ouidaesque hero,
and the book--in three of MACMILLAN'S blue volumes--is fascinating.
Such is the candid opinion of THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.

THE MAN MAKES THE TAILOR.

(_Fragment from a Seasonable Romance._)

It was towards the close of the London season of 1893 that a man in a
strange garb was seen at an early hour in the East End of London. He
attracted considerable attention. It was a rough part of the City,
still, those who lived there were conventional in their costume. They
wore black coats, and there was a certain respectability about their
hats. But the man to whom we refer was eccentric in the extreme. His
straw hat was worn at the back of his head, his cut-away coat was
thrown open, showing a huge, collarless coloured cotton shirt. He had
flannel trousers tucked into digger's boots. No one knew whence he
came, whither he was going.

"Have you noticed him?" asked the Inspector.

"Yes, Sir," replied the Police Constable, "he's got white hands, so if
he belongs to the dangerous classes, he is a smasher, or a forger, or
something genteel in that line."

"Well, keep your eye upon him."

"I will, Sir."

And the strange-looking person continued his way. As he walked through
the City, the merchants regarded him with surprise, but there
were those amongst the stockbrokers who seemed to receive him with
recognition.

"I fancy I have seen the Johnnie somewhere before," observed one
Member of the House to another. "I am almost sure I know the cut of
his suit."

And the man walked on until he reached Knightsbridge. There he was
stopped by an elderly, well-dressed, well-to-do individual, who had
evidently just come up from the country. The two pedestrians started
back when they met face to face.

"What are you doing in that hideous disguise?" asked the senior of the
junior.

"It is no disguise, father," was the reply; "it is only the customary
get up of a young man of fashion between the hours of nine and eleven
when he proposes to walk in the park."

And, with these words, the strange apparition crossed over the road,
and entered Rotten Row. And here he was soon lost in a crowd quite as
eccentrically garbed as himself.

A WAY THEY HAVE IN THE CITY.

SCENE--_Board-room of a Public Company._ TIME--_A few minutes after
the close of a General Meeting._ PRESENT--_Chairman of Directors and
Secretary._

_Chairman._ Well, I think I got in all that was wanted?

_Secretary._ Could not have been better, Sir. You had the figures at
your fingers' ends.

_Chair. (laughing)._ You mean on a sheet of paper in front of me.

_Sec._ And everyone was satisfied, Sir.

_Chair._ As they should have been, considering my flaming account of
the prosperity of the undertaking. By the way, _is_ it flourishing?

_Sec._ Well, Sir, that is scarcely in my department. You must ask the
auditors.

_Chair._ Oh, never mind; it is a matter of no importance.

_Sec._ I daresay if you wanted any information, Sir, I could get it
for you.

_Chair._ No, thanks, I don't want to increase my work. I am sure I do
quite enough for my wretched two or three hundred a year--don't you
think so?

_Sec._ Certainly, Sir. You do a great deal more than some Chairmen.

_Chair._ Yes, I suppose I do. Come here once a year, and preside over
an Annual Meeting, and draw my fees. What more _can_ I do?

_Sec._ I'm sure I don't know, Sir. A knowledge of the duties of a
Chairman of Directors comes scarcely within the scope of my required
services.

_Chair._ Quite so; and now I will say Good-bye!

_Sec._ See you again next year, Sir?

_Chair._ Certainly. If I don't sell out in the meantime. And now
I must be off. I am due at another meeting, and have to get up the
necessary figures in five minutes. Do you think I shall do it in the
time?

_Sec._ Certainly, Sir. You managed the task in less here.

THE FRENCH WOLF AND THE SIAMESE LAMB.

_An Old Fable with a New Setting._

  A little lamb lived by a flowing stream.
    A great temptation, when the heat was torrid,
  To thirsty souls that water's limpid gleam.
    At least so thought a Wolf, of aspect horrid,
  Who, having for some time abstained and fasted,
  Desired to learn how lamb--and water--tasted.
  He felt with pinching want his paunch was pining,
  Early he'd lunched, so longed the more for dining.
    A Cochin China rooster, lank and thin,
    Or something indigestible from Tonquin,
  For a big, sharp-set Wolf, are snacks, not meals;
  So down the sparkling river Lupus steals,
    Quite uninvited, but intent on forage,
    Fronting the fleecy flocks with wondrous courage;
  For whether in the Southdowns, or Siam,
  By the near Medway, or the far Menam,
  Your Wolf is most courageous--with your Lamb!
  With joy the Lamb he spied, then, growling, said,
    "Sirrah! how dare you thus disturb my drink?"
  The Lamb, in answer, meekly bowed its head--
    "_I_ trouble not the water, Sir, I think,
  Particularly as I'm sure you'll see
  It flows--observe the drift--from you to me!
  You're welcome in the stream to slake your thirst,
  But, may I just observe, _I was here first!_"
  "Oh! you chop logic!" cried the angry brute.
    "I can chop, too:--you've done me other wrong.
  Young Mutton, best with _me_ not to dispute!
    You've given me already too much tongue.
  Are _you_ the home-born boss of all Siam,
  Of fleet Mekong, and many-creek'd Menam?"
  Mildly young woolly-face replied, "I _am_!"
    His optics orientally oblique,
    Rolling in manner sheepish, soft, and meek.
  "Oh, _are_ you?" snarled the Wolf. "_We_'ll see about it!
    'Twixt Western Wolf and Oriental Lamb
    Equality is a preposterous flam:
  Do you--as Tonquin did--presume to doubt it?
    Fraternity? Well, I'm your elder brother;
    And Liberty--to you--means nought but bother.
  See, silly-face?" "Well, no," the Lamb replied,
  "Such reciprocity seems all one side.
  Not six o' one and half a dozen o' 'tother!"
  "Pooh!" snapped the Wolf.  "Logic's clear _terra firma_
    Is not for Lambkin, but for Wolf or Lion.
    If you such little games with me should try on,
  I'd treat you--well, as Bull did little Burmah.
  I have imperative claims; I'm going to state 'em
  With lupine brevity in an ultimatum.
    That--after some two days--must stand as Law;
    If after that you give me any jaw,
    My little Mutton--well, beware my maw!"

        MORAL.

  This truth my simple Fable doth attest,
  He who has strongest jaw argues the best!

AT DALY'S.--The Comedy _Love in Tandem_ ought to have been in three
shorter Acts. Mr. LEWIS excellent, so is Mrs. GILBERT, who has not
more than ten words to say, but a lot to act. Spanish widow also good.
Mr. BOURCHIER is a marvellous example of the "Walking Gentleman,"
being perpetually on the move. It is gratifying to see him sit down
for even a few seconds. Like the engineer of the penny steamboat in
the burlesque of _Kenilworth_, he "has very much to larn"; but this
fact need not discourage him, any more than it did Mr. HENRY IRVING,
according to Mr. PERCY FITZGERALD'S recently published book of
Irvingite Recollections, at the commencement of his career. Miss REHAN
is, _par excellence_, the life and soul of the piece; and when there
has been, in her absence, a dull moment or two, she re-enters and
Rehanimates the whole.

THE SCHOPENHAUER BALLADS.

No. I.-THE AQUARIUM OCTOPUS.

  The world is full of pretty things
    That everyone admires,
  And beauty, even though skin-deep,
    Is what the world desires.
  I'm handicapped I feel in life,
    For very obvious reasons,
  And yet my family always think
    I'm lovely in all seasons!

  My time is principally passed
    In caverns under water,
  My family are mostly sharks,
    Except a mermaid daughter;
  She sings her songs and combs her hair
    To tempt unwary whalers,
  And when we lure them down below
    It's bad for those poor sailors.

  I cannot say I like the sea,
    The bottom, top, or middle.
  It's always asking, night and day,
    The same confounded riddle:
  "Why was I made, except to drown
    The surplus population?"
  This is the sad sea wave's remark
    At every sea-side station.

  It makes me think about myself--
    Octopus too unsightly--
  Which are my arms and which my legs
    I never can tell rightly;
  I frighten children--old and young--
    Without the least intention,
  I saved a school from drowning once,
    But that I mustn't mention!

  I'm now at the Aquarium,
    A "side-show" much belauded,
  My antics, shown three times a day,
    Are very much applauded;
  The pay is not extremely large--
    A weekly bare subsistence;
  I take it meekly, for it breaks
    The boredom of existence.

  At balls and parties I've had fun;
    I've listened to Home-Rule disputes;
  There's only one thing I've not done--
    Alas! I've not been down "the Chutes"!

  With screams and laughter from the height
    I saw men splash their nice new suits;
  It seemed to cause them great delight;
    But still--I have not shot the Chutes.

  I've been to all the good first nights,
    I've cried at DUSÉ, laughed at PENLEY,
  I have seen all the London sights,
    I've been to Sandown, Lord's, and Henley.
  At IBSEN I've serenely smiled,
    While suff'ring torture from new boots;
  GLADSTONE I've met, and OSCAR WILDE--
    But ah! I've not been down the Chutes!

  And yet I can't help thinking of
    The damozels I might have married.

  Yes; there was JANET, slim and pert;
    I took her in last night to dinner,
  And cannot honestly assert
    That years conspire to make her thinner;
  Yet once we cooed o'er tea and buns;
    She quite forgets how on we carried,
  Nor owns, with undergraduate sons,
    That _she_ was one I might have married.

  And LILIAN, emanation soft,
    Fair widow of the latter Sixties,

THE RULE OF THE SEA.

(_For the Use of Admirers of the Admiralty._)

_Question._ What is your duty as a sailor in Her Majesty's Fleet?

_Answer._ To carry out the orders of my superiors.

_Q._ If you were told that black was white what would you say?

_A._ That white was black.

_Q._ If you were informed that two and two made five would you believe
it?

_A._ Certainly, and insist that those who thought four was the proper
answer had been gravely misinformed.

_Q._ Would you believe a captain to be always in the right?

_A._ Yes, from a lieutenant's point of view. Although, of course, I
should consider him the weakest of authorities in the presence of an
admiral.

_Q._ Would you ever act upon your own responsibility?

_A._ Never; as such a course would be destructive to good discipline.

_Q._ Then, if you were told to perform an impossible man[oe]uvre you
would attempt to do it?

_A._ Certainly.

_Q._ Even if you saw that the result must be disaster?

_A._ Yes. I should choose the lesser of two evils.

_Q._ To what two evils do you refer?

_A._ Loss of life by my obedience, and loss of discipline by my
disobedience.

_Q._ Which would be the smaller of the two disasters?

_A._ The loss of life.

_Q._ But did not NELSON solve a problem of a somewhat similar
character by using his blind eye?

_A._ Yes; but then NELSON was unique.

carriages and Royal personages to receive me?" Admiral COMMERELL
steered himself along the main roads, and played the part of the
look-out man to perfection. "Nothing in the offing," he reported to
the Emperor. "I hope," returned His Imperial Majesty, with a smile,
"that this sort of thing doesn't offing happen." Everybody in
convulsions of laughter, which just filled up the time till the
appearance on the scene of the Duke of CONNAUGHT on the top of the
cabin, in the full uniform of a General of the Horse Marines. "You're
too punctual by half a minute," called out the Duke to the Admiral.
Then the Admiral piped his eye, and the Royalties lighted cigarettes.
"Here are the carriages! step in!" quoth the Duke. "Aha!" cried the
Emperor gaily, in his perfect English. "Here is the carriage and the
'oss, so now we shall be borne by the 'oss to _Os-borne_!" Every one

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.

_House of Lords, Monday, July 24._--Haven't heard much of House of
Lords this Session. Will take the floor presently, and show Commons
how Legislation should be conducted. For weeks and months they've been
slaving round Home-Rule Bill. Noble Lords, with fuller experience, and
heaven-born aptitude, undertake to polish it off in a week. Meanwhile
have had less work than usual to do. Might even have made long Summer
holiday. Patriotically insisted upon meeting four times a week, to
show, to whom it may concern, that at least they are ready for work.

To-night suddenly blazed forth with amazing vigour. Old friend EVELYN
BARING, taking his seat under new style, Lord CROMER, agreeably
surprised; House almost full; Opposition in high feather; cheered
CADOGAN and the MARKISS with rare enthusiasm.

"I suppose the question is either the Church or the Land?" said
CROMER, looking up his Orders of the Day. "Heard in Egypt those were
only subjects that made you sit up."

"There's one other," said CARRINGTON, to whom remark was addressed;
"though you will say it practically comes to the same thing. It's Mr.
G. Anything connected with him ruffles House with sudden storm. Mr. G.
made HOUGHTON Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. HOUGHTON a charming
fellow; popular in both camps; but being Mr. G.'s selection for the
Viceroyalty, we--I mean they--are bound to go for him."

Went for him to-night hammer and tongues. CADOGAN, not usually a peer
of bloodthirsty aspect, clenched his teeth with ominous vigour when he
discovered HOUGHTON was not present. Had sent him special invitation,
he explained. Had even gone so far as to leave to him choice of
date for his execution. "And now," cried CADOGAN, glaring round the
appalled House, "his Excellency is not here!"

His absence commented on with towering vigour. Lord Lieutenant's
procedure, in his dealing with addresses, "dishonest, dishonourable,
discreditable to all concerned," said CADOGAN, by way of final shot,
intended to sink whole Ministerial Bench.

MARKISS, not to be outdone, denounced Mr. G. as "a despot," and his
colleagues in the Government "a well-trained company of mutes." As
for something Lord SPENCER had said, MARKISS described it as "a
pure invention," which is much politer than Mr. MANTALINI'S way of
referring to similar lapse as "a demnition lie." House sat as late as
half-past six, and went off home in high good humour. "Quite a
long time since we wet our spears," said the MARKISS. "Just as well
sometime, dear TOBY, to show you fellows in the Commons what we can
do."

_Business done._--In Commons Financial Clause to Home-Rule Bill passed
Second Reading.

_House of Commons, Tuesday._--DON'T KEIR HARDIE on again with fresh
inquiry as to misadventure to one ARTHUR WALKER on day of Royal
Wedding. Mr. WALKER (of London) it appears had difficulty with mounted
officer in command of company of troops. Officer says that when
ordered to fall back WALKER seized his horse's rein. ARTHUR says
"Walker!"; didn't do anything of the sort. That remains in dispute.
What is clear is that WALKER got slight scalp wound, inflicted by
the warrior's sword. DON'T KEIR HARDIE wants sworn inquiry into case.
CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN puts whole case in nutshell. "An accident," he
says, "a regrettable accident; entirely owing to fact of the sharp
edge of the sword meeting the man's head, instead of the flat edge."

That was all; but WALKER seems to think it was enough. Carried out on
a larger scale, before and since Waterloo, similar accidents have
had even more direful results. But CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN, by voice and
manner, succeeded in throwing into explanation an amount of conviction
that communicated itself to House, and even quietened DON'T KEIR
HARDIE. The choice of the word "meeting" was perhaps most exquisite
touch in answer. Without venturing upon assertion, it conveyed
impression that responsibility for regrettable occurrence was fully
shared by Mr. WALKER. Meeting implies advance from either side. To
accomplish the contact, Mr. WALKER'S head must have advanced in the
direction of the sword, which at the moment happened to be going the
other way, unfortunately with the sharp edge to the front. Hence,
between the two, the abrasion of Mr. WALKER'S skull.

[Illustration: VIEW OF "COMMITTEE STAGE OF THE HOME-RULE BILL." "CALL"
FOR THE AUTHOR AND MANAGER.]

CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN did not add another word, but everyone who knows
his kindness of heart will understand his unuttered wish that when in
future WALKER takes his walks abroad he will be more careful. At least,
if his head insists upon meeting swords going the other way, he may be
expected to note whether it is the sharp edge or the flat that is out
for the day.

_Business done._--Financial Clause Home-Rule Bill in Committee. A long
dull night, flashing forth at end in encounter between JOSEPH and his
"right hon. friend." Mr. G. in tremendous force and vigour. In its way
it was CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN'S story over again, JOSEPH'S blameless head
meeting the sharp edge of Mr. G.'s sword. Where difference came in was
in circumstance that no one seemed to regard accident as regrettable.
On contrary, whilst the Home-Rulers whooped in wild delight, the
Opposition crowded the benches to watch the fun.

_Friday_, 1.20 A.M.--If there is in the world at this moment a
thoroughly astonished man it is JOHN WILLIAM LOGAN, Member of
Parliament for the South (Harborough) division of Leicestershire. Just
now LOGAN'S mind is disturbed and his collar ruffled by an incident in
the passage of Home-Rule Bill; but he is capable of giving perfectly
coherent account of events. At ten o'clock MELLOR rose as usual to set
in motion machinery of guillotine. Question at moment before Committee
peremptorily put. LOGAN, unguardedly descending from serene atmosphere
of side gallery, reached floor of House; was passing between table and
Front Opposition Bench towards division lobby when he beheld vision of
VICARY GIBBS skipping down gangway steps shouting and waving his arms.
LOGAN, a man of philosophical temperament and inquiring mind, halted
to watch course of events. Something apparently wrong in the City;
things either gone up or gone down; VICARY GIBBS certainly come down;
was now seated beside PRINCE ARTHUR, with hat fiercely pressed over
brow, excitedly shouting at Chairman. As everybody else was shouting
at same moment, Chairman wrung his hands, and spasmodically cried
"Order! Order!" LOGAN had presence of mind to note that whilst VICARY
in any pause in the storm cried aloud, "Mr. MELLOR, I rise to order,"
he was sitting down all the time with his hat on.

That was LOGAN'S last collected idea before personal affairs
entirely engrossed his attention. HAYES FISHER, in ordinary times
mildest-mannered man that ever helped to govern Ireland, took note of
LOGAN still standing in passage between Front Bench and table; effect
upon him miraculous.

"Yah, LOGAN!" he yelled; "get out. Bah! bah! go to the Bar."

Contagion of fury touched CARSON, who had hitherto been shouting
at large. He now turned on LOGAN. "Gag! gag!" he yelled. "Gang of
gaggers." Then, in heat of moment, he cried above the uproar, "Gag of
gangers."

This too much for LOGAN. Hitherto stood everything; now sat down
in contiguity to CARSON. Here is where the surprise came in. Front
Opposition Bench not his usual place, but was nearest available seat.
His standing up objected to; it was certainly against rules of law and
order that prevail in the House of Commons. Very well then, he would
sit down. This he did, taking vacant place by CARSON. But, like the
bo'sun and the sailor strung up for forty lashes, hit high or hit low
he couldn't please them. The scene that followed has no parallel
since similar disturbance took place in Dotheboys Hall when _Nicholas
Nickleby_ revolted and "took it out" of _Squeers_. HAYES FISHER
leaning over clutched LOGAN by the back of the neck and thrust him
forth. ASHMEAD-BARTLETT, seeing opportunity of winning his knightly
spurs, firmly fixed his eyeglass, and felt for LOGAN in the front.

That the table and front Opposition Bench were not "steepled" in
LOGAN'S gore, as were the forms and benches at Dotheboy's Hall in
that of _Fanny Squeers's_ Pa, was due to diversion raised from another
quarter. Irish members below Gangway, seeing the scrimmage, and noting
CARSON had something to do with it, moved down in body with wild
"whirroo!" SAUNDERSON, providentially in his place, sprang up and
advanced to intercept the rolling flood. CREAN being on crest of
advancing wave found his face, by what CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN would
describe as a "regrettable accident." in contact with the Colonel's
fist. Moreover, it was the knuckly end, scarcely less hurtful than the
sharp edge of the sword which laid WALKER (of London) low. CREAN drew
back, but only _pour mieux reculer_, as they say in Cork. Whilst the
Colonel was standing in the attitude of pacific impartiality he later
described to the SPEAKER, CREAN dealt him an uncommonly nasty one on
the chops; the thud distinctly heard amid the Babel of cries in the
miniature Donnybrook below Gangway. Amid moving, struggling mass,
SAUNDERSON'S white waistcoat flashed to and fro like flag of truce,
to which, alas! there was no response. What became of LOGAN in this
crisis not quite clear. Fancy I saw WALROND extricating him from the
embraces of FANNY-SQUEERS-ASHMEAD-BARTLETT. Mr. G. looked on with
troubled face from Treasury Bench. BARTLEY standing up on edge of
scrimmage, pointed accusatory forefinger at him, was saying something,
probably opprobrious but at the moment inaudible.

"So like BARTLEY to go to root of matter," said GEORGE RUSSELL, who
surveyed scene from sanctuary of Speaker's chair. "Others might
accuse JOSEPH of being responsible for disturbance by likening his
old colleague and chief to iniquitous King HEROD at the epoch when
the worms were waiting to make an end of him. VICARY GIBBS and good
Conservatives generally are sure it was TAY PAY'S retort of 'JUDAS!
JUDAS!' that dropped the fat into the fire. Only BARTLEY has cool
judgment and presence of mind to point the moral of the moving scene.
A striking figure in the inextricable _mêlée._ When his statue is
added to that of great Parliamentarians in St. Stephen's Hall, the
sculptor should seize this attitude."

taste of Donnybrook.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
