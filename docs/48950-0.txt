PREFACE


This book had its origin in a preliminary study of the attitude of the
first thirty years of the nineteenth century toward the classics. A list
of the translations which were published during those years seemed so
significant, if only from the point of view of quantity, that it was
deemed wise to extend that study backward and forward fifty years in order
to have the necessary material for a comparative study of the original
list. It soon became evident, however, that there were only two possible
termini for such a study: the establishment of Caxton’s printing press in
London in 1476 and the present year. The result of these searchings is
embodied in the list of translations which make up the contents of this
book.

Certain limitations have, of necessity, been put upon the scope of this
work. With a few exceptions, Musaeus for instance, the survey deals with
Greek literature to 200 A.D. Josephus, because the interest in his work is
mainly religious, has been omitted; and for the same reason the writings
of the early Christian fathers have not been listed. Moreover, in stating
the reappearances of a given translation, I have made no attempt to
distinguish between editions and reprints. To attempt to unravel the
tangled skein of second, third, fourth, fifth editions, and the like,
would in many cases be the work of a lifetime. I do not feel that the
value of this list would be increased by any such attempt. The fact that a
particular book was published at a particular time, with the notation of
any revision or correction which may have been made, is the matter of
prime importance.

Of the sources of this list I have little to say. The list of translations
published in England was gathered largely from the following books: Miss
Palmer’s bibliography of classical books published before 1640, _The
Stationers’ Register_, _The Term Catalogues_, _The British Museum
Catalogue of Printed Books_, _The London Catalogue_, _The English
Catalogue_, Watt’s _Bibliotheca Britannica_, Lowndes’ _Bibliographer’s
Manual of English Literature_, Moss’s _Classical Bibliography_,
Engelmann’s _Bibliotheca Scriptorum_, and the book lists published in the
_Gentleman’s Magazine_, and _The Edinburgh Review_.

The list of American translations has been gathered from Evans’ _American
Bibliography_, Roorbach’s _Bibliotheca Americana_, _The American
Catalogue_, and _The Publisher’s Weekly_. In two respects the American
section is not so complete as might be desired. In a number of cases it is
impossible to give the exact date of publication. Roorbach’s _Bibliotheca_
dates as many as possible and so do the first volumes of the _American
Catalogue_. Leypoldt in the preface to the first volume of the latter
publication regrets his inability to obtain from many of the publishers
the dates of their own publications. In all such cases I have given the
dates covered by each volume in which the translations occur. By this
means nearly all of them can be located within two or three years of the
exact date. The other defect I have found in dealing with American
bibliography is in the lack of differentiation between importations and
reprints. For this reason it is impossible to determine whether a given
English translation was reprinted in America or imported and sold by
certain publishers. So far as possible I have listed the American reprints
of English translations immediately after the original publication or
after the English reprints of it. By this arrangement all the available
facts concerning each translation are presented in one place.

A word, perhaps, is necessary in the way of definition of translation. In
this list I have aimed to include only such works as profess to be English
renderings of Greek writings. In some cases, chiefly before 1700, the
English translation was made from a French, Italian, or Latin version of
the Greek original. So far as possible, such instances have been noted. I
have not included adaptations, paraphrases, and the like; nor have I
attempted to record solitary translations of excerpts from Greek
literature. A book of translations in the literal sense of the word has
been my basis for entering a title in the following list.

The author would be the last one to claim infallibility for this list. One
has but to attempt to gather together any considerable number of titles on
a given subject to come to a realization of the difficulties of the work.
“Here a little and there a little” is a true text in any such undertaking;
and two translations in a bushel of books is no rare occurrence. I have
listed the facts as I have been able to gather them; but I dare not vouch
that in all cases they are complete. I hope some of the more elusive ones
will be added at some future time.

The contents of the two introductory sections sum up certain ideas which
have occurred to me as I have been working over this material. The
sections are intended to suggest rather than to solve the problems which
English translation from the Greek presents. A discussion of the
introduction of the literature of one nation into that of another by means
of translation is not new; but a discussion of such translations as
forming a continuous thread of influence is perhaps slightly different
from any hitherto set forth. A series of studies of translations into
English from various literatures might add something to our present
understanding of literary influences. If this book furnishes the basis for
some such study of the interrelations between Greek and English
literatures, the labor spent upon it will not have been expended in vain.

I am especially indebted to Professors Ashley H. Thorndike and William
Peterfield Trent of Columbia University, to whom I owe much for their
thoughtful advice and assistance. Their continual interest did much to
make a lonely task a pleasant one.

INTRODUCTION




I. The Growth of Translation


                  [Illustration: Growth of translation]

The Growth of Greek Translation. The solid line is original and reprinted
       translations; the dashed line is original translations only.


The history of English translation from the Greek is almost coincident
with the history of English printing. In 1477 William Caxton set up his
press in London and from that press in 1484 he issued his own translation
of Aesop’s _Fables_. The real beginning of serious translation, as is very
evident from the chart accompanying this section, was made in the decade
1530‐1540. From that time until the time of the Civil War and the
Protectorate there was a steady output of translations, not many as
compared with our day, but a proportion consistent with the size of the
reading public of the time.

In the one hundred and thirty years between 1520 and 1650, one hundred and
seventy‐nine translations were published. Of these one hundred and
fourteen were new translations and sixty‐five were reprintings. That two‐
thirds of the total number are new translations is not surprising; for
with the awakening of interest in Greek which took place during these
years, men could not turn to translations made in former years. For this
reason they had to satisfy the demand for knowledge of Greek literature in
the English language by producing their own translations and reprinting
these as the demand required. That the reprints amounted to one‐half of
the production of original translations is interesting as showing that the
demand for translations was not equalled by a supply of new ones and that
translations must have been popular. Printers have never been inclined to
be sentimental in regard to publishing books and any over‐enthusiasm a
translator may have in regard to his author is sure to be checked by the
monetary standards of the publisher. For this reason I would suggest that
the publishers during the latter part of the sixteenth and the first part
of the seventeenth century evidently found Greek translations a paying
proposition; if they had not, they would not have ventured to place so
many translations before a very limited reading public. All this seems to
add one more evidence to the already established dictum that the
Renaissance readers in England were much interested in Greek literature.

During the one hundred and fifty years following the Civil War English
literature was partly under the domain of those principles which are
generally known as neo‐classical. For this reason the facts of Greek
translation are very interesting and to a certain degree provide an index
of the importance of Greek literature during these years. At least five
hundred and four translations of Greek authors were published, of which
two hundred and thirty‐nine were reprintings of those previously printed.
The average number published per annum between 1530 and 1650 was 1.30 +;
whereas for these one hundred and fifty years the annual average is 3.36
+. This increase may be due to the fact that the reading public of these
later years was larger than that of the preceding age; but I doubt if it
was almost three hundred per cent larger. I would much rather attribute
the increase to an equal growth of interest in Greek literature encouraged
by the principles of literary art which were flourishing at that time and
fostered by the steady development of Greek scholarship through those
years. Aristotle’s _Poetics_ was one of the sources of criticism during
these years and, as I shall show in the next section, the interest in
Greek philosophy was predominant throughout the period. The authority of
the classics and the classics themselves were uppermost in the current of
literary thought; hence it seems plausible that Greek translation should
show a positive reaction at this time.

Before leaving this period I desire to point out one or two matters which
have become evident upon a study of the chart at the beginning of this
section. The curve as it passes through the decades after 1650 rises
gradually to a peak in 1720. It is interesting to note that this was the
hey‐day of Pope: his _Iliad_ was published volume by volume between 1715
and 1720. Through the latter years of Pope’s life the curve declines,
reaching its lowest point four years before his death. Shortly after his
death Doctor Johnson began to exert his influence on English literature,
an influence which was powerfully classical. This continuation of the neo‐
classical principles raised the curve again; and Doctor Johnson himself
assisted in producing that result by reprinting a number of translations
in his _Works of the English Poets_, 1779‐81. The decline of the last
twenty years of this period, 1780‐1800, is synchronous with the fading of
the supreme authority of neo‐classical principles; for with the death of
Johnson in 1784 the last star of the first magnitude in the neo‐classical
firmament had set. The curve would go much lower but for the reprinting of
a number of translations in Anderson’s _Poets of Great Britain_, 1792‐94.
As appears from the chart Greek translation was waiting for the tide to
turn and come forth into the nineteenth century with renewed vigor.

The nineteenth century, quantitatively at least, is the most important
period in the history of Greek translation, for more than half of the
total number of translations printed between 1484 and 1916 were published
during these years. As the chart indicates the great numerical advance
came after 1860, although the preceding sixty years had been far ahead of
the previous centuries in the work produced. The reasons suggested for
this great advance in the nineteenth century are: first, a new interest in
Greece itself; secondly, the rise of classical libraries and the
subsequent cheapness of translations; and thirdly a large output, mainly
in the latter part of the nineteenth century, of schoolboy helps.

The early part of the nineteenth century was a time of much interest in
Greece on the part of the English public. The travels of Edward Dodwell,
H. W. Williams, and William Gell, to say nothing of Lord Byron, made the
Greece of that day well known in England. Through all this time, from 1784
to 1818, William Mitford’s _History of Greece_ was proceeding in leisurely
installments. The immediate popularity of the work is but another evidence
of the widespread interest in Greece. I need hardly mention the stress
which was laid upon the classics in the educational system of the time,
for it is a well known fact. The emphasis which was placed upon Greek was
at least equal to that upon Latin. The Classical scholars of the period
such as C. J. Bloomfield, J. H. Monk, P. P. Dobree, and P. Elmsley spent
the major portion of their lives in carrying on the work of Porson and
editing Greek texts rather than Latin. The _Reviews_ from time to time
published articles on new classical books; and that the emphasis was on
Greek rather than Latin is shown by a survey of the classical reviews in
the _Edinburgh Review_ between 1802 and 1836: of a total of thirty‐nine
articles, twenty‐nine were on Greek books. All of these forces encouraged
a new interest in Greece and Greek literature, an interest which was not
so much the purely literary attitude of the century and a half which had
just passed, as a general interest on the part of the whole reading
public.

Another agency of supreme importance in bringing Greece before the eyes of
the English public at this time was the removal of the marbles from the
Acropolis by Lord Elgin. These marbles, the last of which arrived in
England in 1812, were the center of much discussion in England. One has
but to call to mind the caustic remarks by Lord Byron on Elgin in _The
Curse of Minerva_ and _Childe Harold_ to realize the intenseness of the
opposition to taking away from Greece part of the last vestiges of her
ancient glory. The coldness of their reception was finally overcome by
Visconti and Canova, who pointed out their historical and artistic value.
Finally in 1816, after an extensive investigation of their merits,
Parliament appropriated £35,000 for their purchase by the government. From
that time until to‐day they have been preserved for public view in the
British Museum. After the Greek Revolution the service which Lord Elgin
had rendered not only to England, but to the world, was recognized; for
they alone of all the monuments of Greece escaped the ravages of the years
of warfare. The importation of these marbles, then, was another cord which
fastened English attention on Greece; for they provoked public discussion
of the merits of the action, and for those who had access to London,
furnished a physical bond of connection with Greece.

The Greek Revolution, which raged from 1821 to 1829, was another factor in
deepening the interest which the English public had in Greece. After the
outbreak of the revolution, although the government officially ignored the
revolt and added its name to those who refused to admit the Greeks to the
Congress of Verona, the people of England announced in no uncertain terms
their approval of the Greek cause. The grounds for this approval were two:
the Greeks were the people who had in the ages long gone by given
priceless literature and art to the world for which the world had done
nothing in return; secondly, the Greeks were Christians and were to be
encouraged to throw off the yoke of bondage imposed upon them by the
Mohammedan Turk. Such sentiments as these are to be found in the magazines
of the time and in the various pamphlets which appeared in behalf of the
Greeks in the early part of the war. Concretely the interest of the
English public was shown by meetings held in various parts of the country,
chiefly Edinburgh and London, and in the formation of the London Greek
Committee. This committee collected £7,000 by voluntary subscription from
the British public, with which to purchase military supplies for the
Greeks. At the suggestion of Lord Byron, whom the committee made one of
its agents in Greece, the committee assisted in the floating of two Greek
loans in England. The battle of Navarino (1827) which, though considered
as "untoward" by the government, was a brilliant naval success for the
English and French fleets, was heartily welcomed by the English public.
And finally at the conclusion of the revolution the English nation became
one of the guarantors of the constitutional monarchy established in
Greece. Thus through the political events of the decade 1820‐1830 Greece
was kept in the eye of the British public.

All of these factors, the literary interest in Greece and Greek, the Elgin
marbles, and the Greek Revolution, created a desire for things Greek on
the part of the English public. Of these three forces the third was of
course effective only on the generation then living; but the other two
lost none of their power as the century proceeded. In fact the interest in
Greek literature as literature, I do not say as a language, was much
stronger at the close of the century than at the beginning, largely, I
think, because of the efforts of such men as Matthew Arnold, Benjamin
Jowett, and Richard Claverhouse Jebb. The work of these men has been ably
carried on by Sir Gilbert Murray and J. P. Mahaffy into our own century.

Consequently when one turns to view the progress of Greek translation
through these years, one is not surprised to find an abundant and
increasingly large output. The demand for translations grew almost in
direct ratio as the study of the Greek language and the reading of the
literature in the original declined. The interest in Greece which had been
fostered and developed through the century could only be satisfied by an
abundance of translations whose range covered the whole of Greek
literature.

This interest in and demand for the works of these ancient authors
produced a form of publication which was new to the reading public,
namely, the classical library. The first of these was _The Works of the
Greek and Roman Poets, translated into English verse_. This work was
published in eighteen volumes between the years 1809 and 1812; the volumes
were then gathered together and given the uniform date of 1813. The next
library to follow this was _Valpy’s Family Classical Library_, published
between 1830 and 1834. The works, as was also the case with the _Greek and
Roman Poets_, were reprintings of translations already in existence. The
emphasis was placed on Greek rather than Latin literature; for of the
twenty‐seven authors represented in the collection, sixteen were Greek.
Another significant fact in regard to this _Library_ was its price; the
books were sold at four shillings and sixpence a volume, a price which
placed the translations within the reach of all possible purchasers. The
last and probably the most famous library before the turn of the century
was Bohn’s _Classical Library_. This collection of books, at five
shillings a volume, was published in great part between 1848 and 1863. The
aim of the _Classical Library_ was to furnish the British public with
cheap translations of all the important classical works. In the
accomplishment of this purpose the _Library_ was much extended in scope
beyond _Valpy’s_ and made more complete by the translation of all the
works of many of its authors. While in some cases the translations were
reprintings of those already popular, the majority were new translations
made for the _Classical Library_. Of the great popularity of this
_Library_ I do not need to speak; for the translations have been on the
shelves of almost every educated family in England and America for the
last sixty years.

Satisfied with the translations published by Bohn, the reading public of
the latter part of the century made little demand for any other similar
collection of books. The only series of translations of any importance
which was published during these years was _Ancient Classics for English
Readers_, and these contained only selections from the authors with a
great amount of introductory matter. These works, edited by the Reverend
W. Lucas Collins and published by Blackwoods, were sold at two shillings
and sixpence a volume. Of the twenty authors translated in this collection
twelve were Greek. The series was more educational in its nature than any
preceding one and the outlines and analyses in the books were intended for
those who had little or no classical knowledge. The next classical library
of interest to the general reader was _The New Classical Library_ in which
were published translations of Herodotus, Plutarch, and Theophrastus
between 1906 and 1909. The last library and one which bids fair to take
the place of the Bohn _Classical Library_ is the _Loeb Classical Library_,
which was begun in 1912. Once more an attempt is being made to supply the
English reading public with adequate translations of all the classics.
Inasmuch as it is at present incomplete little can be said of it at this
time; but it seems assured of success.

In addition to the translations published in purely Greek and Latin
collections many translations were included in the general collections of
books which became popular in the latter part of the nineteenth century
and are still in vogue. In such libraries as the following were published
translations from the more popular Greek authors, e.g., Aristotle,
Herodotus, Homer, Plato, Plutarch, and the dramatists: _Morley’s Universal
Library_ (1884), _Cassell’s National Library_ (1887), _Lubbock’s Hundred
Best Books_ (1891), _Temple Classics_ (1897), _Golden Treasury Series_
(1901), _World’s Classics_ (1902), _New Universal Library_ (1906), and
_Everyman’s Library_ (1906). There are a few other sporadic publications
in other libraries, which have been noted in the _Survey_ as they occur.

As the publication of “classical libraries” is a nineteenth century
development, so the introduction of schoolboy helps began with the early
years of the century. The work of T. W. C. Edwards in the twenties and
thirties was intended for schoolboy consumption. At the same time one or
more persons hid behind the all‐inclusive authorship of "Graduate of the
University of Oxford" to produce literal translations of the works of the
dramatists. In the middle of the century much of the work of Doctor J. A.
Giles was done to help the schoolboy over hard places. In 1870 and the
following years a new series of translations of the dramatists was brought
out by a “First‐Class Man of Balliol College.” Roscoe Mongan, whose
translations were to a large extent published in _Kelly’s Keys to the
Classics_, began his work in 1878. These translations went over the ground
covered by his predecessors, and spread out into history, epic and
philosophy. Evidently the schoolboys of his time found them very useful,
for many of them were reprinted within a few years.

During the early eighties the “First‐Class Man of Balliol College”
reappeared with a translation of Herodotus book by book. From this time
until the outbreak of the present war there was a steady output of these
utilitarian translations. G. F. H. Sykes, J. H. Haydon, A. H. Allcroft, J.
A. Prout, F. G. Plaistowe, E. S. Crooke, J. Thompson, B. J. Hayes, H.
Hailstone, T. R. Mills, W. H. Balgarnie, J. F. Stout, and others who did
only one or two books, made their translations with the student of the
language as their reading public. Some of these translations appeared in
the _University Tutorial Series_, a collection of books in which the text,
translations, notes, vocabulary, difficult parsings, and test papers were
published.

The work of these men, quantitatively at least, is an important factor in
the history of Greek translation. Between 1850 and 1870 only eleven
translations of this type were published; between the years 1870 and 1910,
however, at least two hundred and eleven schoolboy helps were published.
The following table gives the minimum figures for this kind of translation
during these years.

1870‐1879=26
1880‐1889=62
1890‐1899=86
1900‐1909=37

The falling off in the first decade of the twentieth century may be due to
two causes: first, the decrease in the number of students of Greek in the
schools, which was the result of the great opposition stirred up in the
latter part of the nineteenth century by the advocates of a more practical
education; and, secondly, the ample production of the decade preceding
filled the market and plentifully supplied the demand. I have set forth
here these figures in regard to the schoolboy translation because I doubt
whether the extent of that type of work has been realized by any except
the competing publishers. To no small degree has the total of translations
in the latter part of the nineteenth century been increased by this type
of publication.

In the preceding paragraphs I have tried to suggest the reasons for the
changing fortunes of English translation from the Greek. The quantity of
translations produced between 1484 and 1917 is somewhat larger than is
generally realized: the total number of translations is 2164, of which
1289 are original translations and 875 are reprintings. For those who wish
to see the progress numerically decade by decade I give the following
table upon which the chart at the opening of this section was based.




II. The Translations


I have no intention in the following paragraphs of discussing the ideals
or the criteria of a good translation; for the making of an English
version of a Greek original presents problems little different from those
of translation from any language into English. At this time I merely wish
to call attention to the various kinds of Greek literature which have been
popular at different times during the last four hundred and thirty years.
The extant literature of Greece lends itself in many respects better than
other literatures to a _genre_ classification. I have taken for my
guidance the tabular survey at the close of Professor Jebb’s excellent
_Primer of Greek Literature_ and in grouping my authors have used his
headings and classifications. Of the divisions which he presents in his
table thirteen are to be found in this bibliography. Many of these
headings, such as Philosophy, Drama, History, Fable, Oratory, Geography,
Biography, are self‐explanatory. Under the remaining divisions I have
classed the following authors: Bucolic Poetry contains only the work of
Theocritus, Bion and Moschus; Poetry contains all the other work in verse
except the epic; Romance embraces the work of Longus, Heliodorus, and
Apollonius Rhodius; Epic contains the works of Homer and Hesiod; Belles
Lettres, the work of Theophrastus, Longinus, and Lucian; Learning and
Science, the work of Hippocrates, and others of similar nature.

With this classification I have made a chronological survey of the
translations and summed up my results at the century and half‐century
marks. These results are embodied in the following table in which the
translations have been listed in order of importance from a numerical
point of view. Underneath each heading I have placed the number of that
type which were printed during the preceding fifty years. Where two or
more classes are equal I have placed them within the same rectangle to
emphasize such equality. At the bottom of each column I have indicated,
where necessary, the classes which are non‐existent for each fifty years.

To a large extent the table speaks for itself, for the interests and
preferences of each generation are made self‐evident; nevertheless it may
be worth while to sum up a few of the outstanding facts. The Elizabethans
translated anything which appealed to them and in many cases added to or
at least embellished the translation as they saw fit. Some of their
translations were made from the French, as Caxton’s version of Aesop or
North’s version of Plutarch. One has but to compare Marlowe and Chapman’s
_Hero and Leander_ with Musaeus to realize how little is Musaeus and how
much is Marlowe and Chapman. The Elizabethan translators, moreover, were
indiscriminate in their tastes, largely because their stock of Greek
learning was small and consequently they had no perspective from which to
judge the comparative merits of the works which they translated. “It was
all Greek to them” and therefore proper to be translated. They enjoyed and
believed Artemidorus’ _Dreams_ as much as they did any of the works of
Aristotle. Finally I wish to point out the high place Romance holds in the
fifty years before 1600. This adds to the credibility of the theory of the
influence of the Greek Romance upon Elizabethan prose fiction. All things
considered, the translations of the Elizabethans are thoroughly in accord
with the temper of the times as exhibited in their literature.

It is interesting to note that in the one hundred and fifty years
immediately following the Civil War Philosophy is the chief interest. The
neo‐classicists, theoretically at least, went back to the classics for
their authority. Indeed Aristotle’s _Poetics_ was considered absolute in
all its dicta. Fable and Epic with varying success contend for second
place in their interest. The moralized fable was naturally popular with a
generation which loved the didactic; and the epic, as they often
acknowledged, was a model for their own poetry. The rise of Poetry, such
as Pindar’s _Odes_, Anacreon’s _Odes_, and Tyrtaeus’ _Elegies_, is to my
mind an evidence of the change in opinion and attitude toward literature
which was gradually increasing during the latter half of the eighteenth
century and which finally came to the foreground in the first part of the
next century. Pindar’s _Odes_ were placed directly in opposition to those
of Cowley’s and the lyrics of Sappho were certainly not in accord with the
ideas of the neo‐classicists. Whether these translations were wholly
correct or not, is aside from the point. Men were becoming more interested
in the lyrical side of Greek literature, and this interest exhibited a
taste foreign to sententious didacticism; for none of that is to be found
in the Elegiac, Iambic, or Lyric Poetry of the Greeks. Once again, then,
the kind of translation which the generations enjoyed was coincident with
the prevailing literary taste, and the rise of Poetry toward the close of
these one hundred and fifty years is at least evidence of a change in
public interest.

Perhaps catholicity of taste is the best phrase which may be used to
characterize the nineteenth century. Nothing shows this better than the
table of translations. The Drama, Epic, History, Oratory, Philosophy,
Biography, Poetry and the more minor divisions were all translated with an
abundance which shows a steady demand on the part of the reading public.
The Drama now assumed its place as one of the important elements of Greek
literature and possibly because it was a new found treasure, for the texts
of the dramatists were not edited until the middle of the eighteenth
century, was a little overemphasized. However, as was pointed out in the
latter part of the previous section, the aim of Bohn’s _Classical Library_
was the aim of the reading public, i.e., a complete survey of Greek
literature in English. The nineteenth century, moreover, in addition to
translating practically all Greek literature, insisted upon a certain
amount of literalness in the translation. It was to be the endeavor of the
translator to present his author to the public without any change or
adaptation on his part in bridging the gap between the two languages. Just
what the word literal meant and of how much consequence it was during the
century can be readily ascertained by reading Matthew Arnold’s lectures
_On Translating Homer_ and Newman’s _Reply_.

Whether the twentieth century will carry on the width of interest of the
nineteenth is hard to say. Until the war broke out the present century bid
fair to equal its predecessor. With the coming of the war, however,
translation from the Greek has been forced into the background and how
long it will remain there, is, at this time, a matter of conjecture.

If this table has done no more, it has at least furnished an interesting
thermometer of public taste through the centuries that are past. In all
generations where the public has had the opportunity of choosing what it
would have from Greek literature, the choice has been along lines very
similar in taste to the prevailing literary interest. What lies in the
future is hard to say, for practically everything of importance has been
translated. Probably we shall see repeated what we are witnessing to‐day:
the retranslation of Greek literature for each succeeding generation into
terms of its own conception. Bohn’s _Classical Library_ is now in the
process of being replaced by the _Loeb Classical Library_ and I dare say
sixty years hence some other “library” will replace this one. Greek
literature is no longer a hidden pearl, and, although the interest in the
language may vary with the generations, the people of England and America
have evidently found in it a worth which they desire to keep. If they had
not, the following list of translations would never have been possible.

Aesop


NOTE.—In the following list of translations of Aesop’s Fables I have tried
to avoid including those which were intended for young children when such
works were obviously not translations of any original text. I have not
attempted, however, to make any distinctions in regard to what is Aesop
and what is not.

Updated editions will replace the previous one — the old editions will be

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law
means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the
Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States
without permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect
the Project Gutenberg™ concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a
registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the ebooks,
unless you receive specific permission. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this ebook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use
this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works,
reports, performances and research. They may be modified and printed and
given away — you may do practically _anything_ in the United States with
ebooks not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to
the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.



THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE


_Please read this before you distribute or use this work._

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or
any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project Gutenberg”),
you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project Gutenberg™
License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.


General Terms of Use & Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works


1.A.


By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™ electronic work,
you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the
terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright)
agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this
agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of
Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your possession. If you paid a fee
for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work
and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may
obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set
forth in paragraph 1.E.8.


1.B.


“Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be used on or
associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be
bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that you can
do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without complying
with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C below. There are
a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg™ electronic works if you
follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to
Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.


1.C.


The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation” or
PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an individual
work is unprotected by copyright law in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works
based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are
removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg™
mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing
Project Gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms of this agreement
for keeping the Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can
easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when you
share it without charge with others.


1.D.


The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you
can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant
state of change. If you are outside the United States, check the laws of
your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before
downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating
derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg™ work.
The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of
any work in any country outside the United States.


1.E.


Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:


1.E.1.


The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access
to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear prominently whenever
any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work on which the phrase
“Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the phrase “Project Gutenberg”
is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or
distributed:


    This ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States
    and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
    restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re‐use
    it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
    this ebook or online at http://www.gutenberg.org. If you are not
    located in the United States, you’ll have to check the laws of the
    country where you are located before using this ebook.


1.E.2.


If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is derived from texts
not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain a notice indicating
that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can
be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying
any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a
work with the phrase “Project Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on
the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.


1.E.3.


If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted with the
permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution must comply
with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional terms imposed
by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked to the Project
Gutenberg™ License for all works posted with the permission of the
copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.


1.E.4.


Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™ License
terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this work or any
other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.


1.E.5.


Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this electronic
work, or any part of this electronic work, without prominently displaying
the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with active links or immediate
access to the full terms of the Project Gutenberg™ License.


1.E.6.


You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed,
marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word
processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format other than
“Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version posted
on the official Project Gutenberg™ web site (http://www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other form.
Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg™ License as
specified in paragraph 1.E.1.


1.E.7.


Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing,
copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works unless you comply
with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.


1.E.8.


You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or
distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works provided that

    – You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method you
      already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to
      the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has agreed to
      donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg
      Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60
      days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally
      required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments
      should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg
      Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4,
      “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
      Archive Foundation.”

    – You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e‐mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™ License.
      You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the
      works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and
      all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™ works.

    – You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
      any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
      receipt of the work.

    – You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.


1.E.9.


If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg™ electronic
work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this
agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The Project Gutenberg Trademark
LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation
as set forth in Section 3 below.


1.F.


1.F.1.


Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not
protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg™
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works,
and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such
as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data,
transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property
infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer
virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.


1.F.2.


LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES — Except for the “Right of
Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg™
trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg™
electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for
damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE
NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH
OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE
FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGE.


1.F.3.


LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND — If you discover a defect in this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to
the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a
physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect
to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose
to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in
lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a
refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.


1.F.4.


Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in
paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ’AS‐IS,’ WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.


1.F.5.


Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the
exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state
applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make
the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state
law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement
shall not void the remaining provisions.


1.F.6.


INDEMNITY — You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark
owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of
Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and
any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs
and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from
any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of
this or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect
you cause.


Section  2.


           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™


Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle‐aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at
http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of
Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service.

Section 4.


  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
                                Foundation


Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please
visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.


      General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep
ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each ebook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the ebook’s ebook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our ebooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new ebooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:


    http://www.gutenberg.org


This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new ebooks.
