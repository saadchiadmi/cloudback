THE "CAUDEBEC" COAT-OF-ARMS

* * * * *

The Caudebec Coat-of-Arms is a pointed, oval azure, two metal shield,
with an ("or") gold embattled mural crown or crest.

Across the face of the shield area charges: three argent finned smelts
naiant, placed one above the other.

Near the point of the shield is an "argent" (silver) daisy.

From this, a wreath of "or" (gold) encircles the shield, reaching
nearly the crest.

On the sinister side of the shield, this wreath is a laurel branch,
on the dexter side, an olive branch.  (In heraldry, dexter (right)
and sinister (left), denote the right and left sides respectively, of
the shield in the position as the wearer views it, and not as viewed
by a distant observer). On some of the Caudebec Coat-of-Arms, the
laurel and the olive branches are crossed at or near the shield
point, and are tied by a bow of ribbon.

The azure (sky blue), the royal color of the Bourbons, predominates
in French shields, and denotes justice and loyalty.

The "argent" denotes purity.

The "or" denotes stability and worth.

The smelts were peculiarly and pleasingly flavored fish, with pale
green back, and silvery white lower part.

It has been said that the presence of fish on Coat-of-Arms, denoted
a predominant occupation of an early period.

The olive and laurel denote peace and victory.

Crests were originally a device indicative of high honor, and were
worn upon a helm.  Later they were placed upon and attached to the
shield. It's form and marking indicate a knight.

The emblems of the family later became the emblems of the town of
Caudebec.

INTRODUCTION

* * * * *

It has been my pleasure and diversion during a period of many years
to collect and tabulate data concerning the descendants of Jacques
Caudebec.

This has led to a study of the almost interminable network of
relationship existing between the old families throughout the
Minisink region; to the tracing of the immigration from this region
into many of the states, and the development of families in almost
every State in the Union.

The emigrant and the frontiersman of the early generations have been
succeeded by the farmer, the merchant and the mechanic; later, by
those in every branch of human activity and industry. A people of
high ideals, honest, intelligent, home-making and law abiding, have
ever been exerting an influence uplifting and for the preservation of
liberty and freedom.

Much of this early history is derived from the writings of Peter E.
Gumaer. Much of the subsequent history was given me by my father,
Elting Cuddeback, whose remembrance of these people was accurate,
extensive and reaching back to the times of Peter E. Gumaer. Local
records have been searched. Also those in Kingston, Albany and New
York and Central New York counties. Records have been obtained from
the writings of W. H. Nearpass, while extensive family records have
been furnished by Mrs. Jennie Titsworth Wright of Sussex, N. J., Mrs.
Mary V. Lawton of Skaneateles, N. Y., Mrs. Jane Cuddeback Johnson of
Port Jervis, N. Y., Dr. Samuel Outwater of Lockport, N. Y., Mrs.
Simeon Cuddeback of Milford, Pa., Mr. and Mrs. Egbert Cuddeback of
Skaneateles, N. Y., and Mrs. Martha M. Griswold of Adrian, Michigan.

I deem myself fortunate to have known and learned from those of
earlier generations many facts pertaining to the early history of the
family. A physician comes to know the country, the people and the
families with an intimacy unknown in other relations.

Forty-one years of the practice of my profession among neighbors,
relatives and friends of my boyhood have impressed me with the
desirability of a record of our people and of our family. Families
scatter. Homes disintegrate. Houses disappear. Among the saddest of
my experiences are visits to localities where there is now little or
no vestige of the lives or of the drama of life enacted in the old
homesteads of bygone years. Many, many times in this study, I have
been impressed with the truth of the verses, Psalms 103, verses
15 and 16: "As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the
field, so he flourisheth: For the wind passeth over it, and it is
gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more."

As a heritage for those who may hereafter bear the name Cuddeback,
for allied families, and for all who may note the development of
American families, this ideal development of free men in a free
country is presented. These interminglings of people of various
nationalities--these Americans, will everywhere be a mighty force for
the uplifting of the nation.

That such a people may be enabled to turn to a record of ancestors,
and to delight to know from whence they came is sufficient
compensation for many hours and days of investigation and
collaboration.

PIONEER KNOLL-HOME OF THE FIRST SETTLER


Between the ranges of the Appalachian Mountains as they extend
northward into New York State, lies the Valley of the Neversink
river and of the Bashas Kill. From these the water flows into the
Delaware River at Port Jervis.

The Kitatiny mountains of New Jersey becomes the Shawangunk range in
New York and form the southeastern border of the valley. The Blue
Ridge mountains of Pennsylvania extend northeasterly into New York,
form the northwesterly border of the valley, and extend into the foot
hills of the Catskills. Between these mountain ranges lies the valley
of the Neversink, the Meckheckemeck of the early days, two hundred
to four hundred feet below their crests. It is from one to two miles
wide. It is said to have been part of the bed of a vast lake
extending to the Hudson before the erosion of the mountain which
resulted in the formation of the Delaware Water Gap. At a point near
the junction of the Neversink with the Bashas Kill there is a level
tract of land extending the width of the valley for about three miles.

The early settlers trailed down the valley from Kingston and came
upon this flat land covered with a tall heavy grass (Rheet Grass)
about 1690 and tarried there. About 1696 they purchased these lands
from the Indians, and settled among them. On Oct. 14th, 1697, a
patent for 1200 acres covering this fiat land was granted to Jacob
Caudebec, Peter Gumaer, Thomas, Bernarbas, and Anthony Swartwout and
their associates. This "Cuddeback" patent is described as "at
Maghakameck, beginning at the west bounds of lands called Napeneck,
etc., . . . to a small run of water called by the Indians
'Assawaghkemeck,' etc., (a small stream flowing into east side of the
Neversink opposite Huguenot) and so along the said run of water and
the lands of Mansjwor, the Indian."

This included the level fertile low lands from near Cuddebackville
to Huguenot, and was later called the "Peenpack flats." Near the
center of this "Caudebec patent" there is a knoll extending
longitudinally of the valley, which tradition gives as the location
of the homes of the first settlers. It is oval, about three hundred
yards long, fifty yards wide, and elevated above the surrounding low
lands approximately twenty feet.

[Illustration: Spring Brook, skirting East Slope of Pioneer Knoll.]

[Illustration: Pioneer Knoll, Northeast Slope.]

This pioneer knoll, today grass-grown and a pasture, gives evidence
of its former occupancy. Depressions indicate the location of these
log houses. At its most southerly point, a larger, longer depression
surrounded by fragments of a stone foundation now covered by earth
and sod, indicates the location of an old fort erected at a later
date. About twenty yards east of this knoll is a large brook of the
clearest spring water, while on its eastern slope is located the
remnant of the spring which furnished them water. The accompanying
maps and views show these points, and also show that these pioneers
built their houses in the most approved manner of their day. The
depressions indicative of their cellars are near each other on
different sides, on the brow of the knoll. Between them is the
slightly elevated rounded top of the knoll. Access to and
communication with neighbors from houses thus located could have been
easy, quick and continuous.




DEEDS, LAND, PAPERS ETC.


The following transcripts from the public records at Kingston, New
York and Albany are of value as records of the life and the struggles
of these early colonists. The deeds from the Indians covering a large
acreage, extending in the Meckheckemeck valley from Naponeck nearly
to the Delaware, was made to others besides those named in the
Caudebec patent. This was a cause of differences between owners of
adjoining patents and led to disturbances between the Indians and the
pioneers.

Petition of Barnardus Swartwout on behalf of himself & others, the

To the Hon^ble John Nasan Esq Leu Govonor & commander in chief of

The humble petition of Barnardus Swartwout in behalf of himself and
copartners in a new Settlement at Waghahkowock now the Minissinks.

Showoth

That on the 14th day of October 1695 the petitioners had lycense to
purchase 1200 acres of vacant land at a place called Waghaghkamock,
which being understood by Col& Rutsen and others who were desirous of
the same lands which the petitioners had by (charge?) and pains
discovered found a petition to the Governor and Council afterwards,
to wit: The 9th of January 1695-6 for a lysence to purchase 400 acres
at great little Minissinks Under color of which lysense being upwards
of 20 in number, by large gifts to the Indians and other indirect
(works?) (debauches?) them to (bad?) faith to the petitioners, to
sell the same lands to them, of which complaint was made to the
Governor & Council, & an order thereupon granted that (it approving
the petitioners lysense) was prior to the date of that of Rutsen &
Compa. and the name of the place certain, and (still) it is of ill
consequence to have indirect dealings with the Indians.

That Rutsen and company do desist from any pretensions to purchase
the land mentioned in the lysense of the petitions upon penalty of
answering the same. Upon which order afterwards to wit the 28th day
of May 1696 Rutsen & company prays the Governor & council not to have
ill thoughts of them, and allege that the land that the petitioners
lay claim to by lysense is not called Waghgaghemeck which being ready
and considered in Council, an order issued upon petitioners that
Swartwout and company pursuant to their (wish?) should purchase 1200
acres at Waghgaghkemmack and afterwards the other company their 4000
acres. Notwithstanding all which though Rutsen & company ventured
still privly to (soist?) with the indians and obstruct the lawful
purchase until the middle of the year 1697, when the petitioners to
obtain their rights (forms?) of them verbally (consutod?) to make a
joint purchase with the other company which being done they thereupon
on the 14th of Oct. 1697 obtained his (mahos?) patent for the 1200
acres and betook themselves to the improvement thereof (and?)
(company?) to all right and the former orders without any patent or
first giving (way?) to the petitioners peacably to enjoy their 1200
acres. Many of the other company (purpose?) appointed by and under
them satt down upon the s^d land forcibly that it being far from the
other Christian settlement & mountain (whethr?) in the county of
Elster or Orange the forests could not be removed by the indians that
now Shely-irr-tin through months of Aug. and Sept. left and (devvey?)
other times. The indians chiefly Asawanta Pindamnius, Karhkolano
Sansa and Nashingloan with many others though pretended owners of the
land to the petitioners unknown being stirred up freely by the s'd
other company have fallen upon the s'd Barnardus Swartwout and his
brother another partner and have beaten bruised and badly kicked so
that of their lives they did really despair, and robbed plundered and
carried away their goods haply and have destroyed their cattel, have
(put fire?) often into their houses to burn them in which violent
practices those other company, their wives came to look on and render
the indians & (hindor?) from killing of them. But the men kept out of
the wy which is of very pernicious ( . . . ) and may end in an Indian
warr if life should be taken on any other part which your petitioners
would strenuously avoid, and therefore humbly pray that said indians
may be sent for and made to disclose who they are that put them upon
this violence (sound?) prudent (va^rd?) be taken to prevent future
mischief that such punishment may be enforced to their good.

That the quiet & peaceable possession of their estates to the end
that justice & right may take place according to your honorable great
wisdom and prudence. This y^e pet^rs as in duty shall pray &c.

PIONEER DAYS


These sturdy young people, ambitious, enterprising, accustomed to and
delighting in the hardships of frontier life, found in this valley
and at this place an ideal spot for their purpose. They determined to
place themselves and their families beyond the realms of oppression
and persecution, to live as free as the air they breathed, at a point
relatively near, where their Huguenot countrymen had settled at
Esopus and New Paltz. Game was abundant. Fish were in the streams in
quantities. The soil was fertile, productive and easy of cultivation.
The native inhabitants were kindly disposed and peaceable. Could
anything be more alluring to these after their experience in their
native land? Tradition relates that they were happy and contented in
these new homes for many years. They were governed by a Christian
sentiment and duty. Honor for honest industry abounded. Every person
was comforted and ennobled by a "peaceful, pure and stimulating
atmosphere of personal and religious freedom."

The typical pioneer's home has been described as a log house on
sloping ground, on the brow of a hill, facing and overlooking the
level meadow land, from which a path led up to its front door, which
was about in the middle of the front of the house. Small high windows
are on either side of it. Directly opposite the front is the back
door, larger, wider and level with the ground. It opens against the
sloping ground so that wood may be carried or rolled in or that the
huge back log--the foundation for the fire--may be drawn in by a
horse for the great wide fireplace which fills up one end of the
single room--the "fire room"--the general living room. Across the
ends of the house, logs surround the great stone chimney and are
morticed in with the side logs. Between and around these clay and
earth fill in the crevices.

Before the days when leaded window glass was first imported from
England, thick oiled paper formed their semi-opaque windows.
Sun-dials and hour glasses marked the time.

The ceilings were low, the stairs were short and steep. Ladders led
to sleeping rooms above. The small cellars contained family supplies
to supplement the food furnished by hunting and fishing, in which the
Indian residents joined most willingly.

Indian trails widened to foot paths, as every one walked. Later
travel by horseback was the custom, and pack horses carried their
baggage, food and household effects--canoes and boats were of some
service. For light, a bundle of yellow pine knots was burned in a
corner of the large fireplace. This "candle wood" would be fastened
there between flat stones. Later oil obtained from different sources
was burned, as also tallow in betty lamps or brown bettys (shallow
pewter or metal dishes two or three inches in diameter with
projecting nose over which the wick hangs).

Phoebe lamps were similar but had a second shallow saucer to catch
the drip. Later candles were made by dipping, afterwards by moulds.
The pale brittle green bayberry candles from the taller shrub or
candleberry tree gave most fragrant odor, while later, the brighter
better light of the spermaceti candles was of service.

In the latter part of the 17th century, during the active lives of
the second and third generations, the lands of the patent were
allotted to individual ownership. The several owners then built
substantial stone houses at nearby points in the valley. The "Gumaer
stone house" of the present day was built. The "Cuddeback stone
house," now standing, near the log house by the highway, near a small
run of water just south of Port Clinton and about one mile due north
of pioneers knoll, was built by Jacob Caudebec and his sons.

This has been occupied by six generations of the Cuddeback family. It
is still firm and substantial and a comfortable home. The Swartwout's
possessed Seneyaghquan.

These stone houses, generally irregularly rectangular, were most
substantially built. Entrance was usually through a large double
door, horizontally divided, opening into a large "fire room" at one
end, while at the other end of the house was a smaller room, used as
a dining room or a "state bed room," where a "Slawbank" or a "half
headed bed" was ever ready for the visitor.

[Illustration: Cuddeback Stone House and Nearby Log House.]

The large heavy "lug pole" was replaced later by the light moveable
iron crane with its iron hooks, pots and kettles in the great broad
fireplace. Andirons and creepers were later added to the household
equipment. The ceilings showed great logs and rafters rough hewn and
supporting a board floor or roof with its heavy bark covering.

The attic, beside providing sleeping apartments, had near the
chimney, a room with an opening to chimney and place to smoke bacon,
ham and beef; also a room for grains, storage, etc.

The large deep cellars contained bins for potatoes, apples, turnips,
beets, etc., barrels for salted beef, pork, game and fish--tubs of
sausage, headcheese, etc., and firkins of butter, eggs--shelves
filled with fruit, etc., barrels for cider, vinegar, etc.

In the earlier years, the tables were of boards and the dishes,
platters, etc., were mostly of wood, so were the trenches, the
borols, the tankards, the spoons of laurel wood and the plates of
birch bark. Bottles and drinking cups and noggins of leather and
sometimes of the thin hard shell of the gourd of horn. Later pewter
dishes were substituted. Food was plentiful. Wild native fruits were
in abundance, as huckleberries, strawberries, blackberries, grapes
and cranberries. Wild turkey abounded in flocks. Wild geese and ducks
by the thousands, and pigeons in flocks to obscure the light, and
here were also pheasants, partridge, quail, snipe. These, with the
products of the soil made life worth living, and secured the settlers
comfort and prosperity.

The Indians, friendly and helpful, taught the planting and the
raising of Indian corn, their "gunney wheat" or "turkey wheat"--a
native American food--the grinding and the cooking of it and the
preparation of many kinds of most nutritious foods from it, samp
porridge, suppawn, new samp, succotash, using their handmade mills,
their stump and sapling mortar also. They had great fear however of
windmills. They were also most helpful in killing, securing and
preserving game and fish for winter use. In turn, they learned to
secure wild honey. With wonder they called the bees "English flies";
called the maples "sugar trees" as they boiled the sap and gathered
the sugar.

They joined in the winter sports and pastimes as fox hunting,
squirrel killing, bear bayting, and for a generation lived most
peaceably with the settlers.

For about sixty years, friendly and peaceable relations existed with
the Indians. The French and Indian war beginning about 1755 changed
this. The Indians under French influence withdrew from this region,
became hostile, made life perilous--property uncertain, and committed
many acts of treachery. Afterwards a few of them returned and
remained in the valley until the revolution, when the absence of many
of the men and the influence of the cunning Brandt turned them again
to be enemies of the whites and led to the invasion of 1777 and 1779.

In 1777 the Committee of Safety directed that three forts be built in
the "peenpack" neighborhood. The central one near the house of
Ezekiel Gumaer was near by the Pioneer's knoll. Surrounding the stone
house, on the open land a "picket fort" a stockade was built. Rows of
tree trunks, stakes, etc., were planted upright enclosing several
acres, an area sufficient to accommodate the nearby families. Around
this fort with Capt. Abram Cuddeback in command, many exciting
adventures occurred during the revolution. Gumaer states, "that the
fort sheltered eleven families, aggregating one hundred and thirteen
persons during the greater portion of the years 1778-9."

William Cuddeback, the father of Capt. Abram, was there with his
family. He was an old man and died soon after the revolution. His
son, Benjamin Cuddeback, was at Fort DeWitt, near the present
Neversink highway bridge, at the time of the raid and was in charge
of its defense. After the invasion, he returned to the "Cuddeback
Stone House," "Fort Cuddeback," with his family, where he died about
1782 presumably of typhoid fever.

The upper was the neighborhood of Meckheckemeck, while the lower
neighborhood embracing the valley from Huguenot, south to the
Delaware river was called "Little Minisink Neighborhood." Its forts
were--Westfall, Decker, near the Delaware and Van Auken, the latter
being east of the Neversink where the stone houses afforded the
protection.

After the revolution, more attention was paid to agriculture. The
small farms were again cultivated to a greater extent. Timbers were
rafted down the Neversink and Delaware to market. Saw mills and grist
mills were built in the valley. The cultivation of flax and hemp
constituted a large part of their labor. The manufacture of cloth and
clothing was a household occupation and year end employment for both
the men and the women of the families. The sowing, the cultivation,
the gathering of the flax which must be pulled, dried and ripped and
spread into a "stook" in the field. This was followed by the cleaning,
the drying and the tying in bundles. The new grown hemp must be
pounded, swingled, carded and dried, then swingled, pounded and
hetcheled until the fibers were assorted, spread and drawn ready for
spinning. The raising of sheep, the shearing, the assorting of
fleeces, the carding of the wool--the colorings of "golden rod
green"--the "pokeberry crimson"--the "sassafras orange yellow"--the
hickory-oak bark or indigo as fancy may decide. The skeins bleached,
washed, dyed and dried were wound on bobbins for the loom. Then came
the knitting, the weaving, and the making of the clothing,--broom
corn brooms supplanted birch splint brooms. Such constant employment
invariably leads to habits of economy, to adaptability and
resourcefulness which makes for independence and strength.

This mutual dependence and assistance resulting from their situation
made a "neighborhood" feeling whereby each shared in the profits, the
pleasures and the luxuries of the others. They joined together in
their work and in generous welcome to the kinsfolks. With such
environments, to a people, strong, vigorous, enterprising, voluntary
exiles for conscience's and their religious sake, these develop
strong characteristics in families, more marked in some individuals.

Gumaer notes this development in the earlier generation. He says,
"religious reading meetings were held in the peenpack neighborhood,"
also "the services of an officer were unnecessary in that
neighborhood during the first sixty or seventy years of the
settlement. They had the honesty and the prudence to adjust all
matters relating to their mutual dealings." When roused by fear and
danger they became sturdy energetic soldiers who knew only
independence and self-reliance. The extent of this is shown by the
military records. In the second regiment of Ulster County militia, in
the company of which Captain Abram Cuddeback commanded we find among
the enlisted men six of the name of Cuddeback--William, Peter, James,
Benjamin, Abraham, Sr., Abraham, Jr., five of the name of Swartwout
and several names of each of the families of the region. With such
inheritance, with such discipline, with such surroundings, with
nature as a firm, kind, unyielding teacher, impress of character was
early discernible with these people. These families developed traits
of character and physical stature which has been most noticeable in
members of succeeding generations.

"William Cuddeback, though uneducated, was versed in the scriptures,
was characterized as a wise man in his time." Each succeeding
generation developed its leaders in the religious, business and
social matters of their day, of sterling uprightness and integrity,
among a people gentle, modest, retiring, with strong religious
convictions, with sympathy and helpfulness toward each other and a
fidelity to duty.

Gumaer states, "I have sat many a long winter evening and many an
hour in the day time to hear the conversations and arguments of a few
of the individuals of the second generation. Many of these
communications and remarks were entertaining and instructive as to
what had transpired in this valley, and as to the lives of the
people." Gumaer also states from knowledge gained in this way he
considers "that Col. Peter Cuddeback had the general resemblance to
the early members of the family." His picture herewith presented may
be considered as indicative of the features and general physique of
the family.

[Illustration: Colonel Peter Cuddeback 1795-1892.]

The family life was the community life of the early generations.
Remnants of this have continued in some localities where the husking
bee, the quilting party or the apple cut afford opportunities for the
family to gather and to rehearse tales of the early trials, fortunes
and successes. This family visiting, when all of the family were
included, with its free hearty welcome, and its unreserved and
unstinted hospitality indicated the fellowship of the family as a
group and as the unit in the community and is in marked contrast to
the twentieth century methods where the individual is the unit.

After the revolution, the state lands of Central New York were opened
to settlers. Many of the younger men of the third generation
emigrated to that portion of the state and became pioneers on the
"Holland purchase" and the military lands of the state where their
families have continued to reside.

Later the descendants in the fourth generation, farmers and those of
allied pursuits, became owners of nearly all of the most fertile
bottom lands in the valley. They were jealous of their ownership of
these paternal farms, and guarded them from outside ownership and
intrusion. This spirit developed also in the members of those
families in western New York where they located. Near Skaneateles,
through one section, farm after farm for miles in extent was the
property of a Cuddeback, at Owasco, at Moravia. In Niles township,
at Twelve Corners, the same conditions existed. Farm after farm was
the property of a Van Etten, Westfall, Van Fleet or Cuddeback, or a
relative of one of them in the third or fourth generation, from
Deerpark ancestry.

Similar conditions to a limited extent existed in other sections as
in Wayne County, N. Y., Seneca County, N. Y., Niagara County, N. Y.,
Wayne and Bradford Counties, Pa., near Adrian, Mich., and in Iowa.

In 1745 Roelof Elting bequeathed to his daughter, Jacomyntje Codebec,
certain sums of money--to others lands, which if they sold, they must
first offer to their brothers and sisters at the same price a
stranger would pay.

In this development of families of succeeding generations in
different localities we see illustrated the migratory element of our
people.

These sturdy young emigrants of the middle of the seventeenth century
settled and established their homes near Kingston, N. Y., about 1650
and reared their families there. As their children reached maturity
and began life for themselves, some of them with others, later
emigrants, sought adjacent locations for their homes. The
Meckheckemeck settlement was formed just previous to 1700. Lands were
purchased and the Cuddeback patent was obtained. Here a new
generation grew to manhood. Youth again active, restless and alert
sought other locations. From 1730 to 1750 the lands along the
Delaware, both in New Jersey and in Pennsylvania were attractive. The
younger of the families of Cuddeback, Depuy, Shimer and Hornbeck
established homes there. Records show that some of the Swartwouts of
the third generation, natives of Meckheckemeck, then called
"Pin-peck," or "Peenpack," removed to this section.

As the next generation grew to manhood many of them seeking homes
crossed over into the valley of Susquehanna into the southern central
New York counties. This movement was quite extensive just after the
revolution, when influenced by the DeWitts, surveyors, quite a colony
from Peenpack established themselves in the "lake country" of central
New York.

Again in each succeeding generation similar developments occurred.
Soon after 1800 the active, restless young people from Central New
York emigrated to Michigan and to Ohio accompanied by relatives and
friends from the older settlements on the Delaware and Susquehanna.

These migrations have continued. The more alert or venturesome of
each generation have sought new locations to establish their homes.
They are now in every state of the Union some who are direct lineal
descendants of the emigrant Jacques Caudebec and in the older
locations the network of relationship is intricate and closely woven.

The lands in the valley continued to be most productive during the
first half of the nineteenth century. Substantial stately houses were
built. Large barns and out buildings were erected. The thrift and
prosperity of the farmers continued. The social life centered about
the church and the homes--a broad hospitality prevailed of which the
family was the unit.

During the lives of the fifth and sixth generations, conditions have
changed materially. The varied pursuits of the twentieth century
gives occupation as varied and diverse as their homes are distant
from one another and from the ancestral home of the family. The
exhaustion of the soil, the attraction of the productive western farm
lands, the migration to the cities, all have tended to diminish the
population and the representatives of the family throughout this
entire region of country. It is a fact, however, more than eighty per
cent, of the lands of the Caudebec patent remains today in the
possession of owners whose ancestry may be traced to a patentee.

The first attempt to build a grist mill in the valley was made by
Jacob Caudebec and his sons, near the Caudebec stone house. The small
run of water over the steep declivity just east of the house
furnished the power, the rough stone blocks, the mill stones, were
obtained from the Indians. Grains for both the settlers and the
Indians were ground there for many years, substituting this for hand
pounding with pestle in mortar and for the sapling and stump mortar.

Later other and better mill sites were located in the valley. One of
which was the mill site of Henry Decker on the old dam brook. "Ouwe
Dam Kill"--a dam across the spring brook about one mile northeast of
Port Jervis, overflowed a long, low marshy tract of land extending
toward Huguenot, stored water for power purposes for a mill located
at that point.

Remnants of this dam are visible today just west of the Huguenot
highway where it crosses the railroad as both cross the stream near
Port Jervis. Also foundation stone of the old log house, the mill
house are still visible about twenty-five feet east of the present
dwelling. This property became the property of Benjamin Cuddeback
about 1800. The present dwelling built by Benjamin Cuddeback about
1814 stands today typical of its time in shape, size and structure.
Later it was the home of Elting Cuddeback for eighty years and of his
son, the writer, during his youth.

Jacob Caudebec and Peter Gumaer were French Huguenot refugees.
Caudebec came from Caudebec-en-Caux--a thriving agricultural and
manufacturing town on the Seine in Normandy, France.

These refugees, Caudebec and Gumaer, fled in 1685 to England or
Holland, thence to Maryland, in America, later to New Amsterdam,
thence to Oesopus and Wylt Wyck (Kingston), N. Y.

Jacob Caudebec was born about 1666 in Normandy of a family of
prosperous merchants. In his flight he became separated from his
people. He was unable afterwards to find trace of his own family or
sisters or to recover any of their property. Although the following
story is found among the writings of Peter Gumaer: "Now I have
understood that it had been concluded on between Cuddeback and two of
his sisters that he and Gumaer would go to a certain place in England
or Holland (I am not certain which) and that after a certain time
these two sisters would embark for the same place and bring money to
enter into a mercantile business at the place of their destination;
and that Cuddeback and Gumaer after being landed at this place waited
for these two sisters till after the time for their arrival had
elapsed; and giving up all hopes of their coming embarked for America
and were landed in the State of Maryland; which passage exhausted the
last of their money. Cuddeback had information afterwards, that his
sisters after some length of time had arrived and entered into a
mercantile business; and he was chagrined in consequence of their
having all the money. It was said that after they had arrived
Cuddeback corresponded with them by letters and would often remind
them of their injustice in keeping to themselves all the property;
which I have understood they offered to share with him if he would
come and live with them or they would take and do well by one of his
children if he would send one of them." Ruttenber states that Peter
Gumaer and Jacob Caudebec were the younger members of the families of
Abraham Guimar and James Caudebec. He soon adapted himself to the
different conditions of life of the new world. He found employment
with Benjamin Provost, a trader of New York and Oesopus. He came to
this valley in 1690. On October 21st, 1695, he married in New York
City Margarette Provost, a daughter of his employer, Benjamin
Provost, and Elsje Aelberts who had been married in New York
Nov. 5th, 1671.

Jacob Caudebec is quoted as having said that "by leaving France he
had been deprived of many enjoyments but he had the satisfaction of
leaving his posterity in a country of good land, easily acquired." He
is characterized as of a penetrating mind, persuasive in business, of
speculative disposition, and most tender towards his family. He
retained his mental faculties and physical vigor almost until his
last hour. Three of his sons became farmers on the peenpack flats,
the lands of the patent. On February 15th, 1726, he deeded a
one-seventh interest in the patent to his three sons, Benjamin,
William and Jacob, who agreed to pay certain moneys equally to all
his children. One son and four sons-in-law became farmers near
Shepekunk, in northern New Jersey along the Delaware. In 1715 the
name of Jacob Koddeback appears as member of a foot company of Ulster
County militia, under the command of Col. Jacob Rutsen. On September
1st, 1689, J. Caudebec, a native of France, took oath of allegiance
to King William and Queen Mary.

THE CUDDEBACK PATENT DISSOLVED.


The ownership of the lands of the Cuddeback patent were in the names
of the patentees and allotted as indicated in the chart.

The dissolution of the community ownership of the lands of the patent
was accomplished by an eight party deed of its owners on February
13th, 1768, when Captain Johannas Westbrook, Peter Gemare, Benjamin
Cuddeback and William Cuddeback, Geradus Van Inwegen, Benjamin Depuy,
Jacob Rutsen DeWitt, Abraham Cuddeback and Phillipus Swartwout, as
joint-owners of the 1200 acre patent, deeded to each of their
assignes, as individuals, their holdings. William Cuddeback received
deed for one-eighth part. William and Benjamin Cuddeback received
one-eighth part, which they redeeded to their father, Jacob
Cuddeback, and also received deed for

  lot No. 5 of 1st division of the patent
  "   No. 6    2nd    "       "      "
  "   No. 5    5th    "       "      "
  "   No. 3    6th    "       "      "
  "   No. 5    7th    "       "      "
  "   No. 2    8th    "       "      "
and also for 12 acres of land with all edifices, barns, barracks,
fencing and implements.

No record is found that either John Tyse or David Jamison lived in
the valley. It is believed that Tyse was an older man and was a
resident of Oesopus where records show the baptism of three of his
children about 1680.

David Jamison became the attorney general of the Province of New York
in 1720.

Thomas and Bernardus Swartwout removed down the Delaware valley into
New Jersey at Smithfield or Walpack, where many of their descendants
have continued to live, and today are quite numerous. Some have
changed the spelling to Swartwood. Anthony Swartwout died about 1700.
His widow with her children and second husband, Harmonas Van Inwegen,
continued to live on the lands of the patent.

For more than thirty years, the patriarch of Peenpack, Jacob Caudebec
was the sole remaining one of the original patentees to continue to
live on the patent and in the Meckheckemeck settlement. His fellow
countryman and refugee, Peter Gumaer, died previous to 1732. His will
dated September 24th, 1726, was probated at Kingston, N. Y., October
4th, 1732.

[Illustration: TRADITIONAL ANCESTRAL HOME]




CAUDEBEC IN NORMANDY, FRANCE


The home of our ancestor, from which he fled, a Huguenot refugee in
1685, is a small town on the right bank of the Seine, about midway
between Havre and Rouen. At this point the river St. Gertrude,
flowing down between the two mountain peaks Mt. Calidee and Mt.
Vignette, empties into the Seine.

Caudebec, the capital of Caux, is within a triangle, its base the
bank of the Seine on which is a wharf 13.78 ft. above sea level and
on which runs the government road toward Havre. The apex of the
triangle lies at a point along the St. Gertrude river between the
mountain peaks which have an altitude of about 500 ft.

The region has a light, alluvial, productive soil--soft, mild
temperature and is most healthful.

The valley of the Seine through Normandy is one of the most beautiful
in France, rich in memories, a paradise for the artist and
archaeologist.

For centuries Caudebec was a seaport. The incoming tide, a wall of
water 5 or 6 ft. high, was forced upstream with great rumbling. This
alternating with the natural flowing downstream has caused the river
to become shallow. These factors together with the building of larger
ships have caused the abandonment of Caudebec as a seaport.

As to the origin of the name Caudebec, authorities differ. It is
thought to be of Norse or Icelandic origin, coined by the Normans.
Kalder--Kalt--cold, and Bek meaning a rivulet--Kalt bek (Caudebec)
meaning cold brook and applying it to the St. Gertrude river as it
flows into the Seine.

Traces of former occupation of this region and of varying degrees of
civilization are abundant. For centuries the land was occupied by
barbarous, wandering tribes of various origin. They were continually
disputing, fighting and exterminating one another. About 49 B. C. the
Romans were attracted to this region. They conquered and subdued the
tribes and continued to control that part of Normandy for about five
centuries. There are yet evidences of Roman occupation in and about
Caudebec and of the occupancy of it by barons, dukes and other
royalties. Fragments of Gallo-Roman potteries are found at Caudebec,
also coins stamped with Calidu upon them. Calidu was the chief tribal
town of the Caletes at the time of the Roman conquests of France.
Julius Caesar conquered these people and constituted a Roman colony
on the site of Caudebec about 648 A. D. St. Vandrille founded a
monastry "near a sparkling stream in the forest" which under the
influence of Charlemange grew rapidly. It had many students, at one
time over three hundred. The village of Caudebec was formed below it
and the town developed rapidly in population and importance. This
condition continued until late in the 9th century.

Following this the Franks gained control and established their first
monarchy and with their feudal rules controlled the country and the
people. In the ninth century the Norsemen--Northmen (Normans)
established their colonies and took possession of the fertile valleys
of northern France, where their aggressive industry and assertive
ways enabled them to possess the land. They adopted civilized
manners, language, customs and pursuits and became an energetic,
skillful, warm-hearted, patriotic people--the best sailors, fishermen,
agriculturists, and manufacturers in all France.

In the 11th century Caudebec became the commercial town and the
central market in the land of Caux.

In the 16th century tanneries were established and the manufacture of
gloves and hats developed extensively, becoming the chief industry.
The black hat of Caudebec with the large black feather was made here
as was most of the headgear worn in France. The French court adopted
this Caudebec hat, a large black beaver with a long feather, and
later it was used almost universally in France.

The church at Caudebec is said to be one of the finest in Normandy.
It has suffered greatly by reason of the sectional wars that have
repeatedly devastated the country, especially those of the 16th and
17th centuries. It was built originally in the 11th century and has
been enlarged and repaired repeatedly. The splendid tower was
completed in 1491.

On August 15th, 1415, Henry V of England caused the land of Caux to
be the seat of war, which lasted several years. In May, 1418, the
town of Caudebec, besieged by the English army under generals Warwick
and Talbot, made a heroic defence, but surrendered in September. It
remained in English hands until 1435 when the peasantry of Caux
rebelled against English rule. A protracted war followed which caused
famine and plague and the land was reduced almost to a desert. The
province remained the seat of war until 1499 when Charles VII took
Rouen by storm and later made triumphal entry into Caudebec with an
army of 12,000 men. The country prospered, Caudebec grew--most of the
houses in the town date to that period of the 15th century.

There are few changes in them, as new windows, new doors, but they
remain the same old wooden buildings with wooden galleries suspended
over the narrow, irregular, oddly paved streets. Today in Caudebec
one breathes the air of the middle ages.

The Reformation--the great religious awakening of the 16th
century--developed great sympathy in Caudebec. The Protestants, the
Huguenots (a term borrowed from Switzerland, meaning bound together
by oath) were quite numerous. Religious wars followed. The English
assisted the Protestants--the Spanish, the Catholics. Rival dukes and
princes sought to take advantage of these conditions and conflicts
followed from which pillage, incendiarism, and destruction resulted.

On April 24, 1592, Caudebec capitulated to the Duke of Palma, On May
15th it capitulated a second time to Henry IV of France amid the
cheers of the people.

On April 15th Henry IV issued the "Edict of Nantes" and established
universal liberty and equality as to religious professions and
worship. Great general prosperity followed, especially in manufacture
and agriculture.

On Oct. 17, 1685, Louis XIV revoked "the Edict of Nantes." This was
followed by persecution, pillage, and destruction of property and
people, especially of the Huguenots. Great numbers of people fled
from France and among them our progenitor Jacques Caudebec.

On Sept. 19, 1749, Louis XV visited Caudebec with all the splendor of
the French court. With their enthusiastic Royalist spirit the people
unharnessed the horses and they themselves drew the royal carriage.

Caudebec is to-day a noted summer resort with a population of about
2,000, with fairs three times a year, with annual boat regattas, with
provision for pleasure and entertainment. The people of nearby cities
may thus enjoy its healthful climate and its hospitality.

A recent traveller has thus viewed Caudebec as approached from the
sea by river. "Between the great forest of Maulevrier on our left and
the green meadows on our right is the great broad Seine, fringed with
shady arbors and with rows of modest homely hotels. The graceful
church spire dominates the town which is in the midst of rising green
hills. The old Caudebec, one of the oldest of Norman towns, with its
medieval houses, narrow, crooked, ill-paved streets, was built on the
site of the Roman settlement, Lotum and gives unmistakable evidence
of its antiquity. The quaint windows and doorways, the overhanging
and irregular roofs almost against one another are everywhere visible
and are covered with creeping vines and climbing flowering plants."

  "A LITTLE THING IS A LITTLE THING, BUT FAITHFULNESS IN LITTLE
  THINGS IS A GREAT THING."

  MAY SOME MEMBER OF THE FAMILY COMPLETE AND CONTINUE THIS RECORD,
  AND MAY THE STERLING WORTH AND CHARACTER OF OUR ANCESTORS ENDURE
  THROUGH THE COMING GENERATIONS.

  "RIGHT LIVING IN ITS SILENCE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN WORDS, AND
  CHARACTER, WHEN TOUCHED, RINGS OUT TRUE SWEET MUSIC."

INDEX

[Transcriber's Note: This is William L. Cuddeback's original index
except the numbers after names in this index have been changed from
page numbers.  They are now the reference number for the lineage
paragraph(s) in which a person of that name is discussed or a key to
a listing in the table of contents. Again, superscripts are given to
indicate the generation. A question mark in brackets indicates the
entry could not be verified.  If a number precedes the [?], there is
a possible, though not exact name in that lineage paragraph.]

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Roger Burch, from scans obtained from the Internet Archive.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
